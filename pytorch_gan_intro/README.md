# Pytorch GAN Tutorial

This is the tutorial at: https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f

## Setup and Run

This tutorial requires PyTorch 1.0 or later. We recommend running the code in a virtual environment with Python 3.6:
```
virtualenv -p python3.6 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run `jupyter notebook`

deactivate `source deactivate`


## TensorBoardX
TensorBoard Data is stored in `./runs` path,run `tensorboard --logdir runs` to use TensorBoard
