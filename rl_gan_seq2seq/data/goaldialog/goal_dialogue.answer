Hi...I checked a few options for you, and unfortunately, we do not currently have any trips that meet this criteria.  Would you like to book an alternate travel option?
Yes, how about going to Neverland from Caprica on August 13, 2016 for 5 adults. For this trip, my budget would be 1900.

Thank you!
Where would you like to travel to?
Im thinking to Fukuoka
Did you have any specific dates in mind?
maybe the 15th of August until the 20th
How many people will be travelling with you?
just myself
would the 15th to the 18th work for you?
where would i be staying?
HOTEL Sugoi in Fukuoka
what is the rating
It is a 3-star hotel and your package includes free wifi
and what if i were to go to Essen?
I have a couple of choices in Essen. Are you looking for a 2-star or a 3-star option?
The three star option
Your best choice would be the Relaxation Hotel which is a 3-star hotel and includes breakfast and wifi. It is available either from August 15th to August 27 or from August 27th to September 2nd.  Do either one of those dates fit into your schedule?
these dates don’t look like they would be compatible with my schedule. Hey, how about going to hiroshima?
I apologize, I have nothing available to Hiroshima. Would you like me to explore other options?
Is there a flight to Santiago
I have several that suit your dates.. Your stay would be at the Una casa which is a 3-star hotel and includes free breakfast, wifi and parking, should you wish to rent a car and explore the surrounding areas.  The flight departs on August 15th and returns on the 20th.
can you compare the price of this and the one to the package in St. Loius
The package to Santiago is $2455.37 as opposed to the package to Essen which would be $3016.94. Please keep in mind that the trip to Essen is a longer trip though.
and how much is the trip to Fukuoka and what are the dates?
That package was $3794 based on economy class. It departed on August 15th with a return date of August 18th.
which of these have the best rated hotels?
In Fukuoka, the hotel is a 3-star, in Essen you have the option of a 2-star at $3016.94 or a 3-star at $3073.16 and in Santiago the hotel has a 3-star rating.
it seems to me that the packages in Essen are the best offer. So what are the dates?
Are you interested in the 2-star option or the 3-star option?
the 3 star hotel seems to be the best how much would it be to book a business class flight?
If you are looking for a business class flight, I only have one package that has the availability. It would be at the Motel Ivory which is the 2-star hotel and  is only available from August 26 to September 1st. The total price for that package is $3314.99.
If i were to choose economy class what would it be?
At the 2-star Motel Ivory Safari, for your original departure date of August 15 it is $3016.94. At the 3-star Relaxation Hotel,  it is $3073.16.  Is Essen your final choice for the destination?
yes i believe it will be. lets book the 3 star hotel
Fantastic. Let me get all your information so that we can finalize your reservation.
sounds perfect! thank you!
In Philadelphia you can stay at a 2.5 star hotel for 11 days. As for Fukuoka, 11 days at a 2.5 star hotel would cost 4719.74USD. I can offer 14 days in Essen for 3787.14USD; this would be at a 2.0 star hotel. 4 days at a 2.0 star hotel in San Antonio would cost 2311.48USD.
Let's start with Philadelphia, how much is it I upgrade to business class?
For this hotel in Philadelphia, it would cost 3340.56USD to travel from Maceio by business class.
And for a four star hotel?
Sorry, I only have 2.5 star hotels available in Philadelphia.
Let's see about Fukuoka upgraded to business class and a four star hotel.
I have a 3.5 star hotel available in Fukuoka, The Oceanside Hotel. It has a guest rating of 8.22/10. I could book you a business class trip for 11 days at 6228.88USD.
Is this hotel in the downtown area of the city?
I do not know the location of The Oceanside Hotel within the city of Fukuoka, sorry.
Is there a spa in the hotel?
There is no spa in the hotel, but there is free wifi.
I will keep this option in mind. How about Essen, do you have anything less than 14 days?
Do you have a length of stay in mind?
Around 11 days.
Sorry, I am only coming up with 14 day trips to Essen. Perhaps another nearby departure city would work?
Good idea. What about Canoas?
It seems that Canoas is not in my database.
What about porto alegre
I have multiple 5 day options available from Porto to Essen. 
I would prefer 11 days
Do you have a departure date in mind? Or an approximate departure date?
Anytime in the month of September
Unfortunately I only have 5 days options leaving from Porto available at this time.
In that case, let's go back to the Fukuoka 11 day package.
Would you like me to explore your Fukuoka options leaving from Porto Alegre?
Yes please.
I can offer 13 days in Fukuoka for 5777.48USD.
In that case, I will take the 11 day package. One more thing, is there free breakfast?
The 11 day trip to Fukuoka from Maceia is also during August. However, the Oceanside Hotel does provide free breakfast!
 I'll book this one. Thank you, friend!
Great, thank you!
Certainly. What date do you have business in Mannheim so that I can accommodate your schedule?
Dates are flexible, but I have a company budget of 3100 USD. I'd like to go either in August or September.
Great. I have a 5 star hotel available for 2097.76USD.
how much will it cost?
The above price leaves August 17th and returns August 27th. To leave August 27th and return on September 6th, the price would be 2582.47USD.
What about leaving around September 13th?
You could leave September 16th and return September 26th for 2753.45USD.
I prefer the one leaving on August 17th. Is there free wifi?
The Regal Resort has free wifi as well as a spa to relax at after your business meetings!
That sounds very nice. Does the package include a business class flight?
2097.76USD is the cost for Economy flights. To upgrade to Business class would cost 2674.43USD. Would you like to book this trip with Business class flights?
Yes I would!
Perfect. You will depart from New York at 2:00 pm - Wednesday, August 17th 2016.
What is the time of arrival?
You will arrive in Mannheim at 10:16 pm - Wednesday, August 17th 2016.
Great! And the time at which I will be departing from Mannheim to return to nyc?
You will leave Mannheim at 8:00 am - Saturday, August 27th 2016 and arrive in New York at 4:16 pm - Saturday, August 27th 2016
Excellent. There is a possibility that I may need to bring a co-worker with me. How much would the trip cost for 2 people?
To include a second person on this trip, with both of you flying business class, the cost would be 5348.87USD
I see. In that case I will book this trip only for myself today.
Ok. Have a good day
It was a pleasure! Thank you.
I do not have a travel package to Mannheim from Porto Alegre for these travel dates.  I do however, have packages available from August 17th to the 29th.     Would these dates work for you?
How much would this package cost?
I have two options.  The first option is a travel package which costs 2314.59 USD.  The second package costs 2981.83 USD.  Which one would you prefer?
If I increase my budget to $6000, does that open up any options from August 17 to September 7?

What other destinations can you offer me with these dates?
I have no other destinations available for these dates.  Would you like to change the start date or the end date?
Are there packages for two-week trips within these dates?
I have two possible packages for you.  Atlanta, United States, to Indianapolis, United States or Brasilia, Brazil to Vancouver, Canada.  Which would you prefer?

Do you have an idea of where you would like to go?
I was thinking maybe St. Louis
what city will you be departing from? Any other people travelling with you?
I will be departing from Tijuana. I'll be going solo
I have several options available. A good option would be Chateau Inn & Suites which is a nicely located 3-star hotel. Departure on an economy flight would be on August 27th, returning on Sept 5th.  Total cost for this package is $1324.29. It is also available in business class.
what type of packages would i get if i were to go to Mannheim instead?
 If you would rather go to Mannheim, I have 6 day packages available at a 5-star hotel called The Regal Resort.
im looking for a longer trip, would there perhaps be one in san antonio?
I have 9 day trips available in San Antonio but the departure dates are all in September. Are you able to go in September instead of August 27th?
yes i could as long as i return by September 17th
I have departures available on September 1st, September 7th and September 8th.  I have two choices in hotels - the Vertex Inn or the Winter Hill Inn., both of which are rated two stars.
What would the duration be? and could I see some better rated hotels?
Availability is from Sept 1st to the 9th, Sept 7 to the 15th and Sept 8th to the 16th.  I do not have any hotels available with a better rating. Please do note that both hotels have free parking,  free breakfast and free wifi. Are you looking for a flight in economy class or business class?
they seem very accommodating, how much would this stay on the 1st be compared a vacation in mannheim at the regal resort?
In economy or business class?
for business class
For business class at the Vertex Inn in San Antonio Sept 7 to Sept 15th, the price is $1477.34.
in contrast to mannheim?
Also in business class in San Antonio, I have the Winter Hill either from Sept 1st to 9th or Sept 8th to the 16th at $1477.00.  Business class to the Regal in Mannheim is $3451.00 if you choose to go Aug 27 to Aug 31st and if you pick the week of Sept 6th to the 10th, it is $4249.00.
I think i would like to book the trip to mannheim, leaving on the 27th

Yes, Vancouver.
Great! Where would you like to travel to?
Punta Cana is good!
Great. I can book a trip for 7 people travelling from Vancouver to Punta Cana for 3853.27USD.

I do not have this information for the El Mar hotel in Punta Cana.
How many stars is it?
2.5 stars.
Let's try 4 stars.

I am only able to find hotels with a 2.5 star rating in Punta Cana for that time. 
2.5 stars will do. Can you offer any additional activities?
Unfortunately I am not able to provide this information.
How about breakfast?
El Mar does not provide breakfast.
Are there other hotels in the area that do?
I am unable to find other hotels in Punta Cana that offer free breakfast.
In that case I will book the first one for 1651. 40 USD.

Hi, would you have a budget in mind for this trip?
No, I've recently inherited a gigantic sum of money.  I prefer 4 stars and above, as well as free breakfast if possible, please.
Would you have a special destination in mind? We will definitely look at luxury hotels that are only a 4 star or more rating.
No particular destination in mind, I'm just looking for an adventure. How about Paris to start?
I have the Muse available for 12 days but that is only a 2 star hotel.  However, I do have some suggestions. I have some excellent options available during that time period. A nice 4 star hotel in Calgary, Canada, another nice 4 star hotel in Marseille or a 4.5 star hotel in Frankfurt, Germany all with direct flights from Portland. Do any of these cities interest you?
The Marseille and Germany packages are very attractive. I'd like to know more about hotel in the Marseille package. Is breakfast included?
The Hotel Duchesse in Marseille is a 4 star hotel which provides you with free wifi, but breakfast is not included in the price. It is available from Sunday August 21st to Sunday August 28th. I forgot to ask, will you be travelling alone or with a companion?
I will be travelling alone. How much is this package?
This package on an economy flight is worth a total of $3049.54USD. Are you interested in booking it?
I am, but first I'd like to see what the price is with an upgrade to business class, and perhaps compare this package to the Germany deal.
There are no longer business class seats available for this particular package to Marseille. The Mellow Palms Resort in Frankfurt is a 10 day package available from Aug 19 to Aug 27 and includes free wifi and  free breakfast and has a 4.5 star rating. The total cost on this package, also based on an economy class flight is $3091.3USD.
Is it possible to upgrade the Frankfurt flight to business class?
This package is also only available with an economy class seat.
That's fine. I will book the 10 day Germany Mellow Palms Resort vacation package.
I will get that all booked up for you and send you an email confirmation.
Great, thank you. I will most certainly book my next vacation with you.
Enjoy your trip!
Hello! Do you have any destinations in mind?
Busan
Will you be accompanied by anyone on this trip?

I haven't got any trips to Naples within your budget. I have something available for 3421.98USD though if you would be interested?

Sure! So, 8 days for 481.66? Is that the option you would like to go with?
you got it!
Perfect! I will go ahead and book that for you.
thanks!
What city will you be departing from?

Where would you be leaving from and how long is your trip?
I would be leaving from Sydney and I have to be back by Wednesday, September 7.  I'm so excited!
Do you have any destinations in mind?
Not really. As long as it is within those dates, or even returning a bit earlier,  and also within my budget, I really don't care where I go. I am just happy to get out of Sydney for a while.
Great! I'll see what I can do. What is your budget for this trip?
I just got my big yearly bonus so I have $6100.00 to spend. Send me as far away as possible!
Can I interest you in a 5 day 4 star package to Naples, a 9 day 5 star package in Berlin or an 8 day 3 star package in Manaus, Brazil?
What are the dates for the Berlin package? A 5 star package sounds fantastic, as long as it is within my budget.
You would depart on Saturday, August 27th and return on Sunday, September 4th.
What else is included in that package?
Free breakfast and free wifi. It is well within your budget at 4018.16 USD. Would you like me to search packages in the 5000 USD range?
No, but can you please give me some flight details on it? I don't like flying out too early in the morning! Also, would I be flying economy or business class?
Departure from Sydney is at 12:00pm, arrival in Berlin is at 8:37pm. For the return flight, you would depart Berlin at 3:00am and land in Sydney at 11:37am. This is a business class flight.
3:00am flight out of Berlin? No way! That means I will have to be at the airport at like midnight! What are the dates for the 8 day package to Brazil? Are the flights any better on that one? And how much is that package?
The Brazil package is from August 26th to September 1st at a total of 4006.85 USD. Unfortunately, all return flights to Sydney leave at 3:00 am.
Is it a business class flight also? Do I get a free breakfast and wifi with that one?
The flight is business class and breakfast, wifi and parking are all included in your stay at this 3 star hotel. Can I interest you in a 4 star hotel in Brazil for 5003.33USD and a 8.8/10 guest rating?
Hmmmm that one could be interesting too. A 4 star would be much better. I don't trust 3 star hotels, they are full of cockroaches! Are the dates and flights the same on that package?
They are similar. Departure from Sydney is on August 27 at 11:00am and the return flight is on September 3rd at 3:00am. Breakfast, wifi and parking are all included.
Do you have a flight that departs closer to August 22nd by any chance?
The closest I have is the 3 star 8 day package to Manaus we spoke of earlier. The flight is on August 26th.
How much is the the 4 star rated hotel to Brazil? Was that one on a business class flight also?
The 4 star package to Campinas, Brazil is 5003.33 USD, this includes business class flights.
This sounds like the perfect getaway, Brazil is about as far as I can get from Sydney! Can you book that for me please :smile:? Thank you so much for all you help.

Hi yes i will try my best to find the perfect location! what budget do you have in mind? Where are you from and Where are you thinking of going?
Actually, my bride, who is sitting next to me just told me that she wants to go to Porto! Do you have anything in Porto Alegre? We are getting married in Fort Lauderdale on August 18th, so we want to leave on our honeymoon on the 19th.  I CANNOT spend more than $4000.00 though.
So it seems that there are no packages available to Porto, is there anywhere else in mind?
Well, how about Guadalajara then. I heard it's still pretty dangerous there, but it apparently has some nice beaches! We just gotta keep it under $4000!
im sorry to tell you this but there seems to be no packages for there either, we have dominican republic if you are interested?
I heard the food sucks in Dominican Republic, but if it's within our budget and at least 6 days, I guess I'll take some info on Dominican Republic. Is it at least a five star hotel?
Actually there is only a 2.5 star  hotel
Okay this really sucks, is that all you can offer me? No Porto, no Guadalajara and a crappy hotel in Dominican Republic. Surely you must have other destinations on August 19th???
We have a 9 day trip starting on August 29th to Mexico City in a 3.0 star hotel called Sublime Echo
That does not work for us, we have to leave on the 19th and I only have a week off work. Have a nice day.
it seems that there are packages to Porto but only later in august are you flexible with your dates?
Like I said, we are NOT flexible. The wedding is already planned for the 18th. Good bye.
bye bye
Let me see what I can find you. Where will you be leaving from?

I'm not getting any results for you. Would you like to try different dates?

I can offer you the Hotel Prism, It is, however, a little above your budget
I could add 500 dollars to my budget
This hotel has 3 stars and costs $5315. If you're interested, we can look for hotels somewhere else

I will book this
Hi there! Unfortunately I don't have any vacation packages to Coruscant. Did you have another destination in mind?
No, it has to be Coruscant. We are leaving from Mos Eisley. We are 7 adults and I can spend $2200, no more. Can you find me a package to Coruscant?
Unfortunately I don't have any vacation packages to Coruscant. However, if you're intersted, I can book you a trip for 6 to Kyoto, Japan and still be well within your budget. How does that sound?
Like I said, I need to go to Coruscant. I don't want to go to Kyoto. Why would I want to go to Kyoto? Can you book me a trip to Coruscant or not? If you can't, you are wasting my time!
Unfortunately, I can't find any vacation packages to Coruscant.
Thank you for trying. I will go somewhere else.
No problem! We hope to hear from you again in the future!

I'll be departing from Valencia. I don't have a budget.
And will you be travelling solo?
Yes.
Do you have a time frame for this vacation?
Between August 26th and September 3rd if possible.
How about a 4 star, 6 day trip to Osaka for only 3354.90USD?
When are the dates for this trip?
You would depart on August 26th at 8:00 am and return on August 30th at 2:03pm
What benefits come with this trip?
Free wifi and free parking are all included at the Aquamarine Majesty Hotel.
Is there anything cheaper?
Not within your time frame. Are your dates flexible?
Anything from August 17th to the 30th?
Yes! We have the 6 day package at 2802.33 USD. Does this interest you?
What about the hotel?

Great! Booking is complete. Enjoy your vacation!
Thank you!
Good day! I can book you a 14-day stay in the Tower Hotel from the 2nd to the 15th of September. Your flight would leave from Frankfurt. How does that sound?
We need to leave from Hamburg. Do you have anything leaving on August 30th? We have a week off then and don't really want to change our vacation time. We are also on a budget cause this wedding cost us a fortune so try to find us a real deal please.
It looks like I do have a flight from Hamburg to Naples. I can book you a room in the Tower Hotel from the second to the seventh of September. The best deal I can offer you on this package is 1232.50USD. Do you want me to book this trip?
The 2nd to the 7th of September is not good for us. How about  Vitoria? Do you have anything in Vitoria leaving on August 18th?
If you're leaving from Vitoria, I could book you a flight which leaves on the 19th of August. Would you like to hear more about this package?
No, I would leave from Hamburg still...and go to Vitoria. We have $1800.00. What can you do for us? I apologize but it needs to be around August 30th.
My apologies for the misunderstanding. The closest day I could give you for a flight from Hamburg to Vitoria would be the second of September. You would be returning the following week on the seventh. Would you like to hear more about this package? It is well within your budget.
I suppose a couple of days later is fine, it will give us a chance to recover from the wedding! Yes, please give me more information!
Of course! You would be staying for 6 nights at the Hotel Oro, a 3-star hotel with a 0/10 guest rating which offers free breakfast, fre wifi and parking. Your flight would leave from Hamburg on Friday, September 6th at 10:56a.m. The total cost of this package is 771.36 USD. Would you like me to book this package?
I thought our flight departed on September 2nd?
My apologies, you are correct. Your flight departs on Friday, September 2nd at 10:56a.m. Would you like me to book this package?
Hold your horse! It sounds like a great deal but I need to check with my bride first. I will get back to you.  Thank you for your help.

No problem, I've got you covered! How many will you be traveling with?
We'll be 4, these girls are like my best friends ever! We go to college in Indianapolis
It looks like I have packages for 10 days in San Juan. I've also got a package for 5 days in San Francisco.
We can travel from August 24th to September 10th. we only have $6400 altogether! Plus we really have to have wifi, you need to make sure of that. Free breakfast would also be a necessity
Both destinations fit within your budget, and both hotels offer both free wifi and free breakfast. The San Francisco package runs from the  27th to the 31st of August while the San Juan package runs from the 17th to the 26th. If you would like to compare prices, it is 2164.26USD for the San Juan package and 1955.23USD for the San Francisco package. 
How many stars for the hotel in San Francisco?
You will be staying at Twin Canyon Inn, a 2-star hotel with a favorable 5.23/10 guest rating.
Do you have anything in San Juan leaving Indianapolis on August 24th? The 17th we still have an exam.
Unfortunately the closest departure date I can give you would be the 26th of August. You will be staying at the Fairyland and returning on the 4th of September. This package costs 5678.60USD. However, I would recommend leaving on the 27th instead as this package is only 5236.20USD. Does either of these trips interest you?
You know, I think we'll stick to the SF one, it's just soooooo much cheaper and it will still be a party! Can you book us on that one?? The one at the Twin Canyon Inn, cant wait!
Your trip has successfully been booked! Enjoy your vacation!
Thank youuuuuuuuuuu!
You're very welcome! We hope to be of service again in the future!

Hi let me see if i can help you out! do you have a budget in mind?
It's not necessarily about money, more about what suits our schedule. If you cannot find anything from Punta Cana to Cairo, we can look at other options.
Are these dates flexible?
We can also leave from SF. slightly but not much
I found southern universe inn in Cairo a 2.5 star rating with free breakfast, wifi and parking leaving on August 30th until the 8th of september, all for $1710
departing from what city?
from Punta Cana
That sound great but I want to look at another option. What about from San Francisco to Manaus? Anything available close to my dates?
yes actually we have a few options for you, Hotel Mundo (2.5 stars), Hotel Aquamarine River (2.5 stars) and Tranquil Sanctuary Hotel (3.0 stars). they are all 11 day stays with free breakfast, wifi, and parking
same dates as Punta Cana to Cairo?
they are on the 27th until september 5th but the Tranquil Sanctuary Hotel is the 26th until the 4th
Southern Universe in Cairo works for us. Do you have any seats available in Business class? We don't like to travel economy.
for the 26th?

At the same hotel, Southern Universe? if so, we'll take it! Pease send me flight confirmations by email.
Do you have a budget for this trip?
No I do not
Are you interested in a 5 day stay at a 2.5 star hotel for only 1916.38USD?

I'm sorry, but I can only offer 5 day stays to Chicago. Are there any other places you would like to visit?

I want to try to travel between august 15 and august 18
Unfortunately the closest package I can offer you to those specifications is from the 15th of August until the 27th. Otherwise the earliest you could leave would be August 19th.
ok, i can be flexible on the dates... i will book the package leaving on the 19th for 15 people

We all live in Termina. Anywhere else fun we could take the kids? Do you have anything to Disneyland? We are 5 adults and 11 kids.
I dont think we have anything to disneyland… may you tell me what dates you are willing to travel
We don't really have any set dates, sometime this summer would be great. If Disneyland is not available either, do you have any suggestions for us? Whatever you have that we can get to from Termina.
there seems to be nothing coming out of termina, would you be able to depart from anywhere else?
Not really. What if I increase my budget to $4200.00, can you offer us anything from Termina then?
I apologize it seems there are no flights leaving from termina
I will call around then and see if I can get a deal out of Termina somewhere else. Thank you for your help anyway,

Where will you be leaving from?
I will be leaving from columbus
Are you the only member?
Yup, just me this time
Do you have a budget?
Nope, just get me outta here
Do have any specific dates for your trip?
It has to be between August 18 and September 8
So you want Curitiba, yes?
If that doesn't work I guess I could go to Las Vegas
Unfortunately, there are no results for any flights from Columbus to any of your preferred destinations. Is there anywhere else you might be willing to go?
Hmmm, those are the only days I can get off work. See where else you can send me in that time frame
There are no flights out of Columbus. Is there another place you could leave from?
No, unfortunately I can't. Guess I'll just take a staycation this time :disappointed: Thanks anyway
Sorry for the inconvenience. good bye
Okay, let’s see how I can help, where are you leaving from?
I am leaving from London. I want your absolute  best hotel in Atlanta, whichever one is known for having celebrities stay there.
OK! I found you the best hotel, but you would have to leave on the 30th or for the 25th we have the supreme canopy resort which has a 3 star rating
You don't understand, it is extremely important that I get to ,Atlanta from London on August 25, or even a little earlier and I need to look at anything you have available that is at least a 4 star rating. No celebrity would stay at a 3 star hotel. The 30th is too late.
How about a little later? The highest rated hotel is 3.5 stars does that work? I have one that departs on the 26th
No that won't work either. I told you twice now, I have to leave the 25th or earlier. You obviously can't help me.
I am sorry for being an inconvenience. 
You guys suck!
Sure thing! And where will you be leaving from?
I’m leaving from Chicago! 
Do you have a preference for dates? Or a budget?
We need to leave on Saturday August 27! Unfortunately, all I've got is 3000 dollars. I also shouldmention that we're two adults
And for how many days do you expect to be vacationing?
As long as I need to! I can return whenever I feel like
How about 7 days at the Wolf Inn, a 3.5 star resort for only 2095.50 USD?
Guess what, I want to go to Pun Cana now. What would that cost me?
I can offer you 11 days in Punta Cana starting at 1863.80 USD
What is the hotel like?
It's 2.5 stars with a 7.15/10 user rating. Breakfast and wifi are included
When do we leave?!
August 30th and you return September 9th. I can also offer you a 3.5 star hotel for only 100 dollars more but breakfast is not included, however flights are on the same days.
I was also thinking, what about leaving August 17?
I have one here leaving on August 27th at a 3 star for 11 days at a price of 1899.78 USD. Shall I also look into August 17th?
OH! I like that one on August 27th. What is the hotel called?
Scarlet Peaks Hotel.
Ok… LET’S BOOK IT!
Excellent! I shall execute the booking.
Thanks!
Where is it that you will be leaving from?
I'm in naples
Great! Will you be travelling alone?
Just me this time

Are there specific dates you have in mind?
It's gotta be between August 27 and September 9
Are your dates flexible?
No, my boss wouldn't have it
We have a 6 day stay at the Autumn Treasure Hotel starting on August 27th. This is a 4 star hotel and offers free breakfast and wifi. The cost is 1071.36. Does this interest you?

Guess I'll take the Autumn Treasure Hotel stay then. Could you upgrade my flight to business class? How much would that cost?

Where will you be departing from?
we will leave from  Hiroshima i think, i never know what city i'm in, yes Hiroshima
I have found the perfect destination for you! The Zion Hotel!!!! Its a 9 day stay for this 4.5/5 star hotel, It has a beach and other wonderful amenities. In total for the two of you with business seating it will be 12873
trust me, money is not an issue can you give me the dates and times for the flights please my manager usually takes care of this sort of thing so i have to make sure neither my friend and I have commitments

Hey there! Where will you be flying out from?
We are leaving from Hogsmeade. It is a terrible place and we wanna get awayyyyy
How many people will you be traveling with for this trip?
Me, Ron, Harry, and Hagrid. 4 of us
I can't seem to find any flights leaving Hogsmeade. Do you have another city you could depart from? I could book you a cheap stay in Kyoto if you fly out from Nagoya.
I don't wanna go to Kyoto... how about Nagoya to Toronto???
I can book you a stay in the Hotel Richard from August 24th to September 2nd. The total cost of this package is 10986.39USD. How does that sound?
that's like 11 grand oh my god!! I need to spend like... 1900 or 2900 MAX. Is there anything cheaper to Paris?
How about a stay at Paris' Autumn Treasure Hotel from the 27th of August until the 6th of September? At 2789.83USD this falls well within your budget.
I just need a package to Toronto for less than 2900
I can offer you a package to Toronto which is only 2275.60USD, however your stay would be from the 17th of August to the 27th.
....is there anything to Paris within my dates???
Unfortunately I cannot offer you any packages for Paris. Would you like to try another destination?
let's try Toronto again. where would we leave from&gt;
If you are flexible with your city of departure I can offer you a cheaper Toronto package which leaves from Calgary. Unfortunately this trip is from the 17th to the 24th of August.
Ok.... well maybe we'll just miss a few days of class that week. How much is that package?
The total cost of this package is 1568.64 USD. It includes a stay in the Hotel Eric Perrier, a 4-star hotel with free breakfast and free wifi. Would you like me to book this package?
Wow sweet! That's for the 4 of us?
This is a package for four.
Great. ok let's book it
Done! Your trip has been booked. Enjoy your stay!
great tahnk you
Are there any places you have in mind?
I was thinking about Manaus. I’m looking to spend a good week away
Are you looking for specific dates?
Not really…but I’m on a budget (of course - being a writer and what not). 4500 is what I’ve got to spend. Also, my wife and son will be accompanying me
I have one result for a flight from Ciudad Juarez to Manaus. It is an 8 day stay at a 3.5 star hotel, they offer free breakfast, wifi and parking. The price you'll be looking at is 4178.82. Would you like me to book this?
I’m wondering about Sendai as well though- I could use a little Oriental flare in my writing. Anything available from Ciudad Juarez within my budgeT?
Unfortunately, there are no flights to Sendai within your budget.
ok… Well are there any other options in Manaus? I just don’t wanna jump at the first thing..
Sadly, no. There is only the 8 day stay at the 3.5 star hotel.
And what is that hotel called?
Serene Garden. There is a flight at 10:am on August 25th, and a 3:00 am on August 30th. Would you like me to book one of these flights?
10 am is far more reasonable travelling with a child, so the August 25th package please.
Wonderful! Your flight has been booked! Have a great day and a splendid vacation!
Terrific :smile: Thanks for your service!
Hi how may I help you!
Mah closest friend, Madonna and I want to go to St. Louis. What can you offer. I only want the best, if not I'm going elsewhere.
Okay let me try and find the best package for you, where are you leaving from and when would you like to?
Well, I'm THE Biebs, so you should know where I'm leaving from. But I'll tell you anyways. We leave from Santiago.
When are you planning on travelling?
Good man. Doesn't matter when we leave, but I gotta be back by August 28th. I've got a gig on the 29th.
I found it for you! The lunar, It’s a five star hotel, leaving on the 18th and returning on the 28th
Probably have, you know, with all this fame people need me everywhere to do concerts, signings, just being around... Does it have breakfast included?
Breakfast and wifi
Nothing but the best. Let's take a look at Santo Domingo first (Madonna likes the heat).
Looks like all the hotels in Santo Domingo are 4 stars would any of those work?
I'm willing to give it a try. Breakfast?
Yes it would come with Breakfast wifi and parking!  but it only leaves on the 24th
When does it return?
on the 2nd
What if I left from Tampa?
only 3 star hotels
I'll book the St. Louis one!
perfect! let me go ahead and do that for you!
Greeeeeat! Thanks man! Imma send you free tics
Will you be travelling alone or with a companion?
All alone, and for the first time! If I wasn't so excited, I would be really nervous.
Do you need to stay in Monterrey right until the 15th of September?
My dates are kinda flexible, but I absolute cannot go over a budget of 3100 dollars.
Is a five day package in Monterrey acceptable for you? I have a flight departing on Aug 27 and returning on Aug 30 at the Oriental Peaks Hotel. It is a little bit more than what your budget allows for at 3240.72USD but it is a 4-star resort with an excellent client rating and it includes free breakfast, free wifi and free parking.
Hmmm it's a little bit too expensive... they have another location in Kingston, can we see what's available there?
I have a lot available in Kingston within your travel dates. Are there any special amenities you are looking for at the hotel?
Hmmm well this is the first time I book any kind of vacation... Can you tell me what amenities are usually offered?
In Kingston, I have hotels available from a 2.5 rated hotel to a 4 star hotel. I also have some hotels that are located near the museum for when you have some leisure time.
Wow I'd love to spend some time near the Museum, is this one within my budget?
All are within your budget. I can recommend the Golden Excalibur which is available from Aug 27 to Aug 30, is rated 3.5 stars and includes wifi and breakfast.
Well that one sounds very nice. Can you give me the name of the hotel near the Museum? I'd like to compare the two hotels with my mom.
This one is located right beside the museum. I also have the at the Raven which is a 3 star and the Ebony Manor Inn & Suites which is a 4 star located near the museum.
Great! I'll talk about it with my mom and get back to you tomorrow. Thanks so much for your help!!

amazing thank you so much
How many are you?
A total of 6 adults. We're all trying to find Pokemon.
Where are you located?
Barcelona. I should also mention that we have a budget of 17400 dollars.
I am sure that budget will be perfectly suitable. I have a 10 day package in San Antonio available departing on September 1 for 12758.22.  How does that sound?
That sounds pretty good! Does the hotel have free wifi? We'll probably try to catch some Pokemon around the hotel.
Not only does it have free wifi, but also includes a complimentary breakfast and free parking.
Yes we definitely will need a rental car. Do you have any trips to Essen?
From Barcelona? Do you also require a trip to Essen?
Yes, I would like to compare both trips. If I can't find a Pokemon, I may as well find a Mewtwo. Mewtwo was spotted in Essen
For an August 26 departure, I have a package at the Motel Ivory Safari for an 8 day stay which also includes wifi and parking but no breakfast.
No breakfast? Hmmm we're an awfully hungry bunch so I think we'll stick to finding the Pokemon in San Antonio. What is the departure time?
1 pm on Thursday Sept 1st returning on Saturday Sept 10th at 3 am. Would you like me to proceed with booking the San Antonio package for you and your party of 6?
Yes this packages suits our hunting needs just fine.
Perfect I will proceed then
Thank you for your help!
May I ask what your budget is?
8300 dollars.
Is there any place in particular you would like to go?
Nothing in mind yet, I'm looking for some ideas.
Great! Where will you like to leave from?
Stuttgart
We have a flight to Valencia at a 5 star hotel, the cost of this package is 5695.69, and they offer free wifi. Does this interest you?
Yes it does, can you give me a few more offers that I can compare?
There's a flight to Queenstown, New Zealand for 6347.76 at a 5 star hotel, they offer free breakfast and wifi, and the dates are also from the 15th to 18th of August.
This one is my favorite as of yet. Can you show me one more?
Unfortunately these are the only options.
In that case, let's take another look at the Queenstown package. What are the flight times? It is difficult to take a flight in the middle of the night with young children.
There is a flight that leaves at 7:00 am and one that leaves at 9:39 am. The flights back leave at 1:00am and 3:39 am.
I'll take the one that leaves at 7:00 am are for the return at 1:00 am.
Great! Your trip has been booked! Have a nice day and enjoy the vacation!
Thank you!

I am sorry too. Now I will lose the title of best croissant maker. Goodbye!

Yes, I'll be alone this time.
How does Brazil sound?

Hi there! How can I help you today?
I would like to find a trip to Punta Cana :slightly_smiling_face: I am leaving from :slightly_smiling_face: Birmingham :slightly_smiling_face:
Good morning!
Thanks much appreciated! I'm sooooo excited, I get to go to away for the first time EVER by myself! Can you help me get to Sapporo?
Absolutely, I would be happy to help! Would you be interested in leaving SL on August 27th and returning on September 5th?
That would work with my new internship. I'm on a very tight budget though, the UN doesn't pay for internships!
Oh ok! How much would you like to spend?
Not a dime over $4100, it's all I've got!
Well you’re in luck - I can offer you the dates listed above for $2816.73 !
Cool! Tell me about the package please, I want to make sure it is JUST right.
Absolutely! You would be staying at the Hotel Prism, a gorgeous three star hotel with free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking! You would be conveniently located next to a park and museum as well.
That sounds great but I better check out your flights to Belem on the same dates. The UN also has an office there.  If you have something leaving on the 26th, it would be better.
I have a 4.5 star hotel in Belem that fits your budget! It would leave August 26 and return on September 6th - is this ok?
4.5 stars! Wow, never stayed in one of those! Tell me some more about this package please! :airplane_departure:
Yes! You would be staying at Zion Hotel which is located on the beach and features free breakfast.
And how much is this package?
You could splurge on business class flights for 4069.74 and still be within your budget, otherwise it would be $3155.22 for economy class.
I really need to think about this...I can go to Sapporo for $2816.73 or to Belem for $3155.22, correct? Which one do you thing offers better value?
Correct! The Sapporo stay will last 11 days, while you would be in Belem for 13 days.
How many stars is the Zion Hotel?
The Zion is 4.5 stars!
That sounds like the better hotel. Can't be too cautious travelling by myself for the first time! I will book that deal in an economy class ticket, I'm not ready for business class YET, need to pass that bar exam!
I will go ahead and book that for you.
Sure thing! I can offer you a deal on a 7-day package to Kyoto. Would you be able to leave from Nagoya?
No, I need to leave from Toronto. I need to be there sometime between August 25 and Sept 7. I'll be travelling alone and I am super nervous :flushed:
In that case, I can book you in the Glorious Bazaar Resort from the 25th to the 30th August. This package will cost you 2656.84USD. Would you like to hear more about this package?
August 25th is awesome man. My boss will be impressed. Is this a nice hotel?

You would be flying out on Thursday, August 5th at 9:00a.m. and returning on Tuesday, August 30th at 4:00a.m. Would you like me to book this package?
Not yet, I need to do some comparison shopping. Our head office is in Chicago. Do you have anything leaving on Aug 25th from Toronto
Unfortunately the closest departure date I could give you would be the 2nd of September. However, I can give you a better deal on a flight if you leave on the 7th. Would you like to hear more about either of these packages?
No the 7th is wayyyyyy too late, I need to be BACK by the 7th. What do you have to Porto between Aug 25 and Sept 7th?  Anything under $3300.00? I'm poor!
I happen to have a package for you that's only 2754.13USD. You would be staying at the Golden Keep Hotel from August 30th to September 2nd.
OMG this is so confusing, I really don't know what to do! I better leave on the 25th, yes that will make my new boss happy....I need to go to Kyoto for sure. The Glorious Bazaar Resort sounds like the right choice. What information do you need from me to book it?
Would you like me to book this trip?
Actually, I'm really nervous about booking this right now. I will talk it over with my new  boss and get back to you, thanks!
Not a problem! Where are you leaving from and which dates would you like to leave between?
I’ll be taking off from Ulsan, I want to Leave on August 27th
I have a number of 6 day packages available to Ulsan. Do you have a budget?
I have a budget of around $3800, can we see what that get’s me?
How about a 4 star getaway to the Amusement for only 2495.75 USD? Or for 3072.42 USD with business class flights.
I’ll be honest I'm a pretty reputable photographer and i need to capture some juicy shots of Madonna. I need to get to her Hotel But im not sure which it’ll be, Is that the best Hotel you got?
At 4 stars, The Amusement is the best star rating that I can offer. Others are only 2 stars. However, I can extend your stay to 11 days for 5223.62 USD.

Where will you be departing from?
Calgary!
How does seven days at the Nova Resort sound? Only 2521.51USD If you fly out on the 27th.
Is that the most expensive hotel… i’ll tell you this im stalking a high profile celebrity
If you're looking for the most expensive hotel, I can book you for 7 days at the Hotel De La Felicidad for 2629.67USD. Or, if you'd like the most expensive package I can upgrade you to business class for 700USD more.
is this all on the 21st
Yes, this package is from the 21st to the 27th of August.
This is just too perfect book it
You've got it! Have fun in Barcelona!
thank you i will!
Hello.
i need to get to Rio de Janeiro
You can leave Recife Saturday August 27th
but I can only leave from Santos
For less money on the same day you can leave and spend 261.99
I will offer you $20000 to get me there
You only need to spend 261.99 good bye
ok very good
I can help you with that! Any dates in mind?
The date doesn't matter; i just need to pay less than $1400. $1300*
Unfortunately the cheapest package I can offer you is 2814.82USD. Did you have any other destinations in mind?
Okay that definitely does not work. How much would it cost to leave from Guadalajara instead?
It would be significantly cheaper, however it would still be over your budget :disappointed:
What if I were to increase my budget to $1700. Would you be able to find me anything departing from Puebla at that price point?
The best deal I can offer you would be 1819.63USD for Guadalajara to Hamburg.
I can definitely assist you with that. What will your departure city be and do you have a destination in mind?
We are leaving from Salvador. Do you have any trips to Kingston?
I have plenty of packages from Salvador to Kingston. When is your Spring Break?
We have pretty flexible dates, we were hoping to fly out between September 2nd and 17th
Do you have a budget for this trip?
Yes, our total budget is of 14200
I have 6 day and 8 packages available. Any preference?
It depends, what kind of hotels and activities are included in the packages?
I have 2.5 star, 3 star 3.5 star hotels available. All of them include free wifi. A couple are located near the museum and a couple in the heart of the city near the park. Which location are you more interested in?
Being in the heart of the city sounds good! Or do you have any close to the beach?
Unfortunately, I have nothing available close to the beach in Kingston at the moment. In the heart of the city, I have the Cosmos Inn available for 6 or 8 day packages. This is a 2.5 star hotel which also includes free parking and a free breakfast. You can fly to there either on economy or business class and still stay within your budget.
ok! Are any extras included in the price?
No there are not. Would you like me to provide you with some pricing on the 8 day package via business class?
Yes that would be great. Could you give me the price of the 8-day package in economy and in business so that I can compare?
Cosmos Inn - 8 days in economy class is available from September 8th to Sept 14th. The total cost on this package is 9141.53USD.  Cosmos Inn - 8 days in business class is available from is also available on the same dates for a total cost of 11812.93USD. I can manage this for the 5 of you.
Great thanks! Last question about this package, does the hotel have a pool or other amenities?
I am sorry, but I do not have access to this information in my database.
Alright, that's ok. The other destination we were considering is Lima
I have a 9 day package available at the Wolf Inn. It is a 3.5 star resort located near the park. It includes free wifi, free parking and a complimentary breakfast and I only have economy flight available at this time. The total cost is 14057.6USD, so it comes in just under your budget.
That sounds pretty good! Otherwise do you have anything close to the beach?
I apologize. All of our resorts  located close to the beach in either Kingston or Lima have already been booked up. Would you like to look at other possible destinations?
Those are the two destinations we were considering. Can you give me any additional information about the Wolf Inn?
The flight departs on September 8th at 11am and returns on September 15 at 2am . Again, this is in economy class seating.
Ok! If we increased our budget to 15200, would there be other packages you would recommend for Lima?
No unfortunately Wolf is the only resort in Lima available at the moment.
How about in Kingston, would other options become available with a slightly higher budget?
That's pretty all that is available in Kingston too. Would you like me to proceed with booking before there are no places left?
Yes! Then we will go for the Lima package at Wolf Inn!
Perfect, I will take all your information down and proceed with the booking. Have a nice day!
Thank you very much!

Sadly there are no trips available to Orlando at this time.
Are there any weekend flights you can book for us to Orlando at any point before September 15 this year? That would be flights leaving on a Saturday and returning the following Tuesday. Thank you once again :slightly_smiling_face:

It is not a luxury hotel but it has 3.5 star rating with a very good guest rating of 8.86/10.  It included free wifi, free parking and a complimentary buffet breakfast. Does this interest you?
Ok, i'll keep this one in mind. Do you have any trips to outside the US?  Even if the hotel isn't as fancy we might prefer that.
Well I do have the Opportunity Suites, which is a 4 star hotel located in Rosario departing on Sept 4th  and returning Sept the 6th. It is only a 3 day package but it fits within your time frame and has a higher rating. The cost on this one is 2203.67USD.

I have no five day options, however I also have a nice package in Sansot, Brazil at the Starlight which is a six day package departing also on Sept 2nd and returning on Sept 7th. This is a 3.5 star hotel located near the museum and also near the palace.
Sounds like Miami might be the best option for us then,  at what time are the flights?
The flight departs from Santa Cruz at 12pm and returns on Sept 5th at 6am. It is an economy class flight.
Ok we will book that one!
Perfect, I will take care of all the details for you and send over a confirmation. Thank you for booking. We wish you a pleasant afternoon.

Where do you live and do you have a wish list of places to go?
We live in Los Angeles and we don't have any places in mind, we are just looking to stay at a nice beach resort where we can swim in the ocean, tan, play with the kids on the beach, have some drinks at night, that kind of thing
When will you be taking your vacation?
Between August 27th and September 3rd!!
You are in luck, We have availability at the Glorious Cloak Inn in St. Louis, which is located right by the beach. This is a 4 day package which included wifi and free buffet breakfast for the whole family. This is a 3 star hotel with a 7.15/10 guest rating.
Do you have anything longer? We were hoping for about a one week package. It's quite a hassle to fly with the kids so once we get there we want to stay longer than 4 days
I have a package available out of Los Angeles flying out to Columbus. This one would be at the Crown Jungle Inn and it is a 6 day long package. It also includes wifi and parking but breakfast is not included. The good news is, it is also close to the beach.
That could be cool! What are the dates and the price for this one?
The price is $7796.72USD and the dates from August 27 to Sept 1st. This is price is based on an economy class flight.
ok thanks! Ya we would be flying economy. The only thing is that i'm not sure how warm the water is in Columbus, do you have any packages for further south? We are really looking for a tropical beach kind of vacation :slightly_smiling_face:
St. Louis and Columbus are the only places available that are on the beach at the moment.
Oh no! What if the end date was flexible? It's less ideal but we could be back as late as September 14th if that gives us better options. And we don't need to leave exactly August 27th, as long as the trip is about a week long.
Do you have a budget for this trip?
We don't have a budget set, but like I said we want to fly in economy
I have the Summer Covert Club located in Atlanta, United States, also on the beach. This one here is a 7 day package that is available to you from September 8th to September 14th also on economy class for 3463.11USD.
That sounds good! How fancy is this hotel?
It is a 3.5 star hotel with free wifi and free parking. It is a brand new hotel so it does not have any guest ratings yet.
That sounds really good!! I'll book this one :slightly_smiling_face:
Fantastic, glad we could help you plan and book your vacation. I hope everything is to your satisfaction.
Yay!!!! I'm so excited for this, thank you for all your help!

You are all booked for this trip!

I am happy to help you with your request. First of all, I would need to know which city you will be departing from.
I'll be flying from Monterrey
May I ask what your spending limit is please?
My budget is 3800 and I really can't go over that
My shortest package in Porto time wise is 13 days. Is that too long?
As long as I'm in Porto for the dates I gave you,  a longer stay is fine as long as the trip is in my budget! Actually, it could be kind of fun to stay longer, I would have time to do some sight seeing as well :slightly_smiling_face:
I have a flight departing from Monterrey to Porto on August 27 and returning on Sept 8th. The price on that one is $3072. It is a 3.5 star hotel close to the University.
That sounds great! Does it have good reviews? It's my first time travelling alone so I really don't want to be stuck somewhere unpleasant
It has an excellent guest rating of 9.16 / 10. It is also close to the shopping district.
Fantastic! Ok, ill keep this one in mind. The second city I could go to is Punta Cana
I only have one place available in Punta Cana at the moment which unfortunately does not fit into your required dates. The only departure is on Sept 7
Alright, scratch that. How about for Brasilia?
There are no available flights from Monterrey to Brasilia. Would you like to look at package number one again, the one to Porto? That package seemed to suit your dates and budget.
Yup! That one definitely seemed to suit my needs best! Give me a minute to read over the info again and I'll see if I have any other questions. oh yes! I will probably need to get some work done at the hotel, is there free wifi included?
Not only is there free wifi, breakfast is also included in this package. Would you like me to go ahead and book this for you?
Great! Yes please!
I will proceed with the booking then. Thank you and have a good trip.
Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:

ok I will book that one
Which price interests you?
786.39
Great I will book this for you! Your trip is from the 30th of August to the 11th of September. Have a great trip!
ok thank you
You're welcome!
Absolutely! When would you like to go? And where are you located?
We live in Punta Cana, looking to travel between August 25 and September 5. Can you tell me how much it would cost to go to Pittsburgh?
Ok! Sure! How many of you would be travelling?
Two adults and two children
Would you be interested in travelling from August 27-September 2?
Potentially, if that's all you have. Can you let me know how much that costs?
That would cost $3961.65 for your entire family.
Yikes, that is over our budget of $2300. Can you see how much a trip to Indianapolis would cost?
I can book Aug 30-Sep 7 for  2031.51USD
Could you find something that fits within August 25 to September 5?
Not in Indianapolis, I’m sorry :disappointed:
Alright. In that case, can you check prices going to Toronto?
I can book August 27 until September 2nd for 1807.58USD.
Excellent. What kind of hotel comes with that package?
The hotel is 3 stars with a user rating of 8.86 stars. The hotel has free wifi, parking, and breakfast.
And are the flights economy or business class?
Economy
How much would it cost if we upgraded to business class?
Sorry but I don’t have any business class options available.
Okay thanks for your help. I will get some feedback from the Mrs. and come back to you with a decision soon!
Will that be 2 adults and 1 child?
Yes exactly!
Where will you be departing from? Do you have a special destination in mind?
We live in Portland and we don't have any destinations in mind, we look forward to your suggestions! Our constraint is that our budget is of 4800$
I have a package available to Miami which suits your dates perfectly. It would be at the  Triple Aegis which is a 3 star hotel quite a bit under your budget. The total cost for your entire stay would be $2134.14. How does that sound?
How long is this vacation for?
10 days. It departs on August 31st and returns on Sept 9 on an economy class flight.
Ok! That is a pretty good deal for the length of the trip! Do you have options for trips outside the US?
I have Ciudad Juarez or I have a 9 day package available in Mexico City, Mexico at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites 3.5 star, on the beach, close to the shopping district and beside the mall. It included free wifi and parking. The cost on this one is also within your budget at 2284.41USD.
What an attractive sounding package? Does the hotel have good reviews?
It has an above average rating of  8.37 / 10
Great! I might need to get some work done in the evenings, is there wifi or computers I can use at the hotel?
There is free wifi
That works for me! Last thing, can you give me the dates of this trip?
Departing Sept 1 and returning Sept 9.
Fantastic, i'm looking forward to this! Can you book this for us?
I will proceed with the booking and send confirmation. Have a nice day.

Hi Hugo! Where are you going?
We reside in Mannheim, and have been eyeing Miami as a possible destination for quite some time.
Ok! Are all of your children travelling with you? Any other adults?
They sure are! Do you have a flight for two adults and five children leaving on the 27th of August, returning on the 7th of September.
I do have a trip leaving on August 27 until August 31!
Hmph that is unsatisfactory
Sorry :disappointed: When would you like to return?
We would have preferred to returned on the 7th of September, as I have previously stated.
You could return on September 5 instead!
Would this also be leaving on the 27th of August?
No, you would leave on August 31.
Since you are unable to make our Miami plans come to fruition, then perhaps you may be of more use helping us book a flight to St. Louis instead. Same dates, also leaving from Mannheim
I can book you from August 27 until September 5? I hope that might be somewhat satisfactory for you.
That is a marked improvement indeed. What are the costs associated with such a journey?
At the 5 star hotel, Lunar, you would pay $18155.
Are there cheaper alternatives? That is far beyond our budget
Sadly, no.
This is most unfortunate. In that case, we shall look to travel closer to home: can you book us a flight to Essen instead
Same details as before
Only thing available is from August 31-September 3.
For comparison's sake, what is the cost of the trip to Miami from August 31 to September 5
8970.25USD
Is there any chance you could lower that? We will make do with budget airlines and seedy motels. Its time the young'uns see the real world anyway.
I cannot negotiate the price.
Very well. How about the price for the trip to Essen?
2293.34USD
Do you have a budget?
noooo
Yes, it's great! Are you travelling with anyone?
I LOVE travelling alone without having to worry about any budgets!!
When would you like to leave?
oh ok like, tommorow?!
Unfortunately there are no results in my database for flights from Fort Lauderdale to Rome.
Okay, send me to Birmingham
I'm sorry but I can't get you there out of Fort Lauderdale.

I guess $150 is not that big a deal and this one works with the games, just go ahead and book it. Thanks, bud.

The package to Hamburg is 9 days
looks to me like they are pretty equivalent but just to be sure, Hamburg is downtown?
I can confirm that the Traveller Inn is conveniently located near the heart of the city.
I have discussed is with my fellow students and we have decided we will go to Hamburg are you able to help us book that
Absolutely! Would you like for me to book the travel package to Hamburg?
yes please! :relieved:
Excellent, I have just completed your booking and will send an email confirmation to you shortly. We hope you have a wonderful trip! :slightly_smiling_face:
Good morning! How may I help you?
I’ve been tasked with booking my own little Brady bunch a dandy tripadoodle the end of this summer :smile: There’s me, my wife, and 7 little angels. We would like to check out our options in Mexico City, leaving from Munich, with a budget of 12600.
I'd love to help you with that! The first package I can offer you is a 7 day stay at Hotel Tropic which is close to the beach and shopping. It would be from September 2nd to 7th. Would those dates work for you?
Wow, yippee! That’s a stupendous sounding vacation! Oh yes, those dates are just fine. I guess I should’ve told ya earlier but we are free to travel from August 30th until September 12th.
Great! Should I book this one for you or would you like to consider more options?
I’ve gotta be good and thorough though, this trip is gonna set the standard for all our family getaways to come. What else is available?
Another option for your family would be to spend 7 days at the 3.5 star Exalted Willow Resort & Suites. This one is also close to the beach and would come out to 10688.56USD.
Oh, so how many stars was the Hotel Tropic spot you first mentioned?
That one had 3 stars.
Ok! Now, I have another destination that I’m interested.. are there any packages available if we went to San Diego?
In San Diego I can offer you a week long package at a 2.5 star hotel, Majestic Mountain Inn. It includes free breakfast, wifi and parking. The total cost of this holiday would be 10956.9USD.
Ok.. well, we are also thinking about visiting Essen as that’s where my wife’s family is from. Could you tell me anything about packages to Essen from Munich ?
Essen would be a much cheaper destination. I have an 8 day holiday package at the Relaxation Hotel available. You could fly in business class for 3702.62USD.
Hmm yes, of course. Far more affordable to travel domestically. I think Mexico City would be far more fun that seeing the crusty in-laws… Let’s go back to those packages. I think I’d like to book Exalted in Mexico City. It sounds very exotic and beautiful.
Sure! Would you like to go ahead with a booking or would you prefer if I check for more options?
Let’s do it :smile:
Is this a trip for one adult?
yes just lonely ole me
Can you please give me the dates you will be free to travel?
I have to leave on Friday Sept 2nd and I have 5 days off
I can offer you 4 day vacations to Calgary or Burlington. Which one would you like to hear about first?
4 days works fine for me.  Burlington is supposed to have amazing museums and quite the night life.  What do you have close to a museum?
For the days you requested, none of the hotels available are close to a museum. However, we do have a 2.5 star hotel in the heart of the city.
How much is this place in Burlington?
Your stay at Excursion Motel would be 612.32USD. The rating, if you'd like to know, if 2.5
And Calgary?
The Calgary package is 290.10USD and 4 stars
So it's cheaper even though it is a 4 star?
Yes it is!
what else do you have in Calgary?
The 4 star hotel which is the Amusement is the only one available for the weekend. The only option I can offer you would be to upgrade to a business class ticket which would increase the cost to 387.34USD
what's it close to?
It is close to a university
anything else included in the price?
This hotel offers free wifi and parking
no breakfast?
No, there is no breakfast included in the price
so you only have the 2.5 star hotel in Burlington and the 4 star hotel available in Calgary. No other choices for the upcoming long weekend of Sept 2nd?
Exactly, those are the two packages I can offer you at the moment
okay I was looking for a little more variety in options, thanks anyway!
I'm sorry we didn't have what you were looking for. Have a good afternoon!
Certainly, how many adults and how many children will be traveling on this trip?
I travel alone and my solitude is the source of my suffering.
That sounds excellent! Do you have any dates in mind?
I care not about the arbitrary constraints of calendars.
You are in luck! I have a trip from August 31 to September 7, where you would be staying at the Olive Summit Hotel, a picturesque 4-star hotel located near a park. Free wi-fi is included, and the total cost of the trip is 801.13. Should I go ahead and book this trip for you?
I do not wish to be located near a park and I do not want to have to be exposed to the sounds of joyful youths’ merrymaking. I need more options.
I regret to inform you that all Lima hotels in our database are in close proximity to parks. Would you like me to conduct a search in an alternate destination?
How miserable. Yes, please search for Seattle results.
Certainly! I am pleased to present you with a trip to Seattle from September 6 to 11, where you will be staying at the inimitable Emerald, a 5-star institution located near the airport. Free parking comes standard with this hotel, and the total cost comes to 1323.78. Would this option be to your liking?
Yes, I would like to stay near the barren desert airport and be confined to the comforts of my own room. Please book this.
Done! Its a pleasure to have your business; we will send an email confirmation to you shortly. We wish you a joyful voyage!
Thank you. I will be full of joy.
Hello! Can I help you with any travel plans today?

I can help you find something! Can you please give me some details about what you are looking for like dates, budget, departure and destination?
I don't really have a budget, I will grab the best deal. I had to fight with my boss for some vacation time and he finally gave me from Friday the second to Tuesday the thirteenth off so it HAS to be somewhere in those dates. I live in pittsborgh and I was thinking La Paz might be interesting, that way I could practice my espanol.
Unfortunately there are no packages in La Paz available between those dates, did you have anywhere else in mind?
Mexico City please
The best deal I have for you is a week long stay at Sublime Echo, a 3 star hotel by the beach. The total price would be 743.74USD.
can you please provide me with flight details - dates and times. I hope this is in economy, I want nothing to do with business!
These flights are in economy!   Pittsburgh to Mexico City taking off at 10:00 am - Wednesday, September 7th 2016 and landing at 12:47 pm with the return flight taking off at
4:00 am - Tuesday, September 13th 2016 and landing 6:47 am
that's cutting close returning on the 13th but I guess that's fine! what does my package include?
Sublime Echo offers its guests complimentary wifi and parking.
how about a nice Mexican breakfast?
I'm afraid that's not included in the price.
okay well it's still a good deal, please go ahead and book it...a week away from this hell hole will do wonders for me!
Great! I'll go ahead and book it for you.
thank you you are a lifesaver!

For those days, I have one package which is a 4 day stay at the Gentle Tower Resort. Its a four star hotel close to the beach and the airport and it has excellent user reviews. Is that a long enough stay for you?
We would prefer something longer....winter is coming. How about south to Baltimore. What do you have available there on the dates I gave you?

I have a lot of options for you. To narrow it down, are you looking for something close to the beach or in the city? And did you have a vacation length in mind?
We have to be back by September 7 so about a week? We live near the beach so it would be fun to visit some museums somewhere, make it a learning experience for everyone
Sure! I don't have any holiday packages to Atlantis, but I can offer you a 7 day holiday in Chicago. Galaxy Temple is a 2.5 star hotel located close to a park and to a museum. How does that sound?
How much is that?
It would cost 6326.16USD, so well within your budget.
do you have 4 star or more hotel available? the kids would love that!
The fanciest hotel I can offer you within your budget and date constraints is the 3.5 star Sunrise Elephant Hotel in Punta Cana. It is not close to a museum, but there is a cathedral and a palace nearby.  You would be staying there for 6 days between September 2nd and 7th.
what if we stayed until the 12th and increased our budget by $200? What could you do for us? Forget the museum, I don't know what I was thinking, the kids will be bored to death. Back to the Atlantis idea, anything near a beach?
I still don't have flights to Atlantis on those dates but how about this: I could send you to Exalted Willow Resort & Suites for 8 days. This is a 3.5 star hotel in Mexico City and its close to the beach, shopping and a mall. It has really great user reviews.
I've heard of that place! I used to be a travel agent and I actually sent someone there myself, not sure why I didn't think about it! is this below our budget?
The total would come out to 7701.59USD.
and what are the dates?
September 1st to the 8th.
this looks like the perfect place to get away, thanks for your help!
My pleasure! I'll book it for you and you should receive a confirmation shortly.

We live in beautiful Frankfurt! I don't know, I was asked to look into Munich.
I have a luxury package to offer you:  A  six day stay at the Regal Bluff, a 5 star hotel close to a university. You could even fly there in business class for 1752.90USD and still be way under your budget. The dates of this package are from September 6th to 11th. Do those work for you?
We were hoping for a longer vacation! That one sounds very nice and luxurious but let's check out beautiful Paris?
The longest package I have for Paris is a 9 day holiday at the 4 star Autumn Treasure Hotel. Would you like more details about this option?
yes absolutely
Ok so complimentary breakfast and wifi are included in the price of 2698.30USD. The package would be 3171.76USD if you preferred to fly in business class. The dates of your stay would be from August 31st to September 8th.
That one sounds pretty good. I need to look at your packages in Belem, see if there is anything on the beach there.
I have several options for you. The first is an 11 day holiday at the Zion Hotel. It is a 4.5 star hotel by the beach. The price includes free breakfast wifi and parking. The dates this package are from August 24th to September 2nd and it would cost you 5530.24USD.
That's a bit too soon for us
What dates would you prefer?
We can only travel during beautiful September from the 1st to the 14th
Then I can offer you a shorter stay at the same hotel from September 8th to the 14th. This 8 day package would cost you 4930.52USD in economy.
I kinda like this one myself! There's no way I can book without wifey's approval. I will let her know about all the fantastic packages you have available and we will call you back to confirm. Thank you for all your help, life is beautiful!
Glad to be of use! I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hi, I dont have anything at that price range
I guess I can increase my budget by 1000
Sorry, I dont have anythnig
Sure, I can help you with that! Where will you be leaving from? And do you have any dates in mind?
We are from Campinas. We can depart on August 27 but must return on September 17
I have no trips to Queenstown that return on September 17th. Do you have any other destinations in mind?
do you have anything that returns before Sept 17?
Yes I have several that return before he 17th. What is your budget? That would help narrow down the options.
We have $4000 to spend.
I have two 5 star hotel packages to offer you. Both are 8 days long,  include the same amenities and are in your budget. The first is from September 8-14. The second is from August 30th to September 5th. Do one of these sets of dates work better for you?
Can I have the names of those hotels please?
Yes of course: The first one is the Illustrious Pool Hotel and the second is Silver Orb Palace
both of those seem like they would work well for use, what do you have within those dates available in San Juan?
I have both 9 and 13 day packages. How long of a holiday were you hoping to take?
a 9 day with 2 kids seems like long enough!
Fair enough! We have a stay at the Supreme Seaside Inn & Suites, a 2.5 star hotel which would cost you 3099.11USD or a stay at the Fairyland, a 4 star hotel which would come out to 3572.48USD.
and the dates for these are?
The first one is from September 6th to 13th and the other one is from September 8th to 13th.
One more destination, I promise. My wife wants me to make absolutely sure that I get ALL the information. Do you have anything in Porto?
I do not have any trips to Porto. Do you mean Porto Alegre?
yes Porto Alegre.  Out of the 4 resorts you suggested in Queenstown and San Juan, are any of them on the beach?
Those resorts are not on the beach
do any of them include breakfast? It's always nice to eat breakfast at the hotel!
Supreme Seaside Inn & Suites, Illustrious Pool Hotel and Silver Orb Palace serve a complimentary breakfast to their guests
okay well they are all within our budget! Once I speak to my wife I will get back you you to book!
Ok! See you later!
Absolutely! What date were you planning to leave and return?
I’m looking to ~book~ for 2 adults and one child. Doesn’t matter, but I’d like to spend around 2 weeks there.
Great, we have a trip from August 25 to September 9, from Paris to San Jose! You will be staying at the Snowy Nugget Inn, a charismatic 2.5 star hotel with a 9.16/10 guest rating. The trip will cost 5664.72USD in all, would you like for me to go ahead and book for you?
Tijuana is another possible destination. What’ve you got there?
I've got a package to Tijuana from September 2 to 13 at the Resort Jade Covert, a 3 star hotel with a 7.15/10 guest rating. The trip will cost 6085.91USD - would you like to confirm this booking?
Where is the hotel located within the city? Close to any amenities?
The Resort Jade Covert is located near shopping, and provides a bevy of amenities including free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking. Does this trip sound good to you?
What about snowy Nugget Inn?
Snowy Nugget Inn is situated near a park and a museum, and offers free breakfast, free wifi, free parking. Would you like to book here instead?
Ok, that sounds more appropriate. Yes, please book the hotel in San Jose.
Its booked! We hope you have a truly magnificent trip!
Thanks
Do you have a budget?
no I am very flexible with the price. but I would like it if it could be around 3300 for 7 adults
I am sorry, but  I don't have any results for that
I could increase my budget by 200.
Hi, so after double checking, I found that we do have something to Long Beach
No, that wont work. hmm i guess i'll have to go somewhere else. that's okay. Thanks for the help anyway.
Goodbye

It is from Tuesday August 30th, to Saturday, September 3rd. Departing at 7am and coming back at 3:39 am.
Thanks, can you tell me the price?
it was 4535.75USD
Ok cool, I'll take it.
Absolutely.  Where would you be departing from and what cities would you like me to check for packages?
I live in Goiania and the first city I'm considering is Kobe. And it's not a paid internship so I was hoping to spend less than 2000 on flights and accomodation
Do you have any particular dates you would like to travel on?
Ok, I need to be there from August 31st to September 12th.
would you prefer to stay in Kobe for 4 days or 7 days?
I need to be there for the entire duration of my internship
For Kobe, I have packages available well under your budget, but the longest one available is a 7 day package either from Sept 1 to to Sept 7 or Sept 6 to Sept 12
Ok thanks, but that won't work for me. I guess I can cross Kobe of my list. How about Detroit? Do you have anything there for the dates I gave you?
The longest available package that is within your dates in Detroit is an eleven day package departing on Aug 31st and returning on Sept 10th. This is about as close as I get to your dates in Detroit. Would you like me to tell you more about this package?
That's too bad! I think its better if there for the entire span of dates they gave me. It would make a bad impression if I left a day earlier. How about Leon?
For Leon,  the longest package I have available is a nine day package from August 31 to Sept 8. The package that most suits your dates is the package in Detroit.
Alright, can you tell me more about the detroit one then?
I apologize but my search results were not the correct ones. I do not have any flights available to Detroit from Goiania.
Ok, well I guess I'll look elsewhere, thanks anyways!
OK! Would you like to travel to Atlanta instead?
No, they aren't going there.  I need to get to Beijing from Mexico City and I need to leave yesterday. I have 2700. If I need to I can increase my budget by 1000
I’m sorry but I have no flight packages to Beijing. How about Punta Cana?
ew no. I need to go to Beijing
Would you like to go to Atlanta?
nope I want to go to Beijing
I’m sorry but I cannot book you a travel package to Beijing. How about Punta Cana?
nope, I guess I'll have to find another way to get to Beijing....... peace out

We  are here to help you with your request.  May I please have your city of departure and destination city?

Our wedding is August 31st so leaving September 2nd would be perfect. Any 8 day packages?
Our earliest available package is on Sept 6 and is a 10 day package. Does that work for you?
My wife would really like us to leave as early as possible after the wedding... How much is it? And how many stars does the hotel have?

That leaves way too late for us and we really can't go over budget :confused: Do you think my wife would mind if we only left September 6th?
If you could depart on Sept 7, the Pleasant Court Inn in Cleveland has a special on a 7 day package for only  476.70USD.
She is really nervous about us spending too much so a sweet deal might make her happy. Plus then I can afford to take her to fancy restaurants  and to the theatre every night for a week haha. What have previous guests thought of this place?
It has a guest rating of 8.98/10. This package includes free wifi, free parking and a free breakfast. It is located near a park and the theatre for your entertainment.  Would you like me to proceed with booking?
Wow thats super high! Ya, please book this for us, it would have been better to leave earlier but at this point this might be the best we can find
would you like an upgrade to a business class flight? That package is 532.10USD and departs on the same day.
YES PLEASE! for that price, I can treat my beautiful bride to that
I will take care of that booking for you. Thank you for booking!

Ok :slightly_smiling_face: In that case I could book the two of you for 4977.33USD
That's a bit expensive! Do you have any cheaper deals?
I’m sorry, nothing available for two people at a lower price from Punta Cana to Milan :disappointed:
What about if we left earlier? Like the 25th?
I do have options available leaving on the 25th, however they are more expensive.
Ok, let me see them
Let me know when you are ready to book :slightly_smiling_face:
My husband didn't want to come anyways and we can't afford to both go so I guess i'll book hotel for one person
Ok, sure thing! I will take care of that for you
Thank you!
Let’s see what I can offer you! When are you planning on taking your trip?
Anytime between August 30th and the 13th of September
In that case I can offer you the Secret Bay from Sept 2-8 for $2628.
Sounds like a cool hotel! Is it fancy?
The hotel is not yet rated.
ok, how about if I went to Porto Alegre?
Wait, I also have a 4 star hotel in Rome. The Hotel Emerald Legacy offers free wifi and breakfast, is located near a cathedral, and would cost just about 3000 dollars for an 8 days package.
oh cool! what was included in the other one?
Secret Bay also features free wifi and breakfast
so where could I stay in Porto?
12 days at the Breakwater Hotel in Porto would run you 4674.68USD. The hotel is 3.5 stars and features free wifi and free breakfast!
would Seattle be cheaper?
13 days at the Fairyland in Seattle would cost you 2759.69USD.
not bad! I forgot to ask, is the one in Porto close to anything interesting?
Not that I can tell.
how about the seattle one?
It's right in the heart of the city
I've also been dreaming of Kyoto
Leaving Nagoya, 7 days in Kyoto could cost you as low as 153.17USD
including breakfast?
Of course!
Which hotels have good user reviews?
Quiet Garden Resort in Kochi has 8.22/10 user review. That would cost 527 USD for a 7 days stay. Also available would be the Southern Palace Hotel with a user rating of 6.61. 11 days at this hotel would cost you $539.
I meant among all the hotels you offered
The Fairyland has 0/10, Breakwater has 8.8/10, Secret Bay has 0/10, and Emerald Legacy has 8.22/10.
I think it's between Fairyland 8 and Breakwater
Ok. Pick one.
How many stars does Fairyland have?
3.5
with breakfast? :smile:
No breakfast :disappointed:
I'll go to Porto then! The price difference is definitely worth the price difference!
Awesome :slightly_smiling_face: Consider it booked. Enjoy your stay!
Can you just confirm the dates with me?
September 3-13 would be your dates at the Breakwater Hotel.
Awesome! ya please book it for me!
Ok :slightly_smiling_face: Enjoy!

My other destination is Hiroshima
I have two different hotels available in Hiroshima within your date range, but both packages are only 4 days in length.

I have a 6 day stay at Hotel Eric Perrier near Toronto airport and a cathedral available from Sept 2-6. Eric Perrier boasts a 4 star rating with free wifi and breakfast included. The cost for this package would be $3348.
And that's the longest one you have?

Ok give me the Santos one then! One extra day of bliss with that one haha

 that's okay, I'll come back at a later date. Thank you anyway 
That is ok :slightly_smiling_face: I will guide you through it. I’m here to help you find the best vacation packages to fit your needs. Maybe we can start by you telling me where you are located and where you would like to explore travel options to.
Ok thank you! I live in San Juan and I have two destinations in mind. The first one is Chicago.
Great, do you have a window of travel dates that you are limited to?
No, but I am really hoping to be gone for 10 days.
Would 11 days be ok? I have a trip from Aug 31-Sept 10 in Chicago leaving from San Juan for 1324.90USD
An extra day should be ok. For how many people is that price?
That’s just one adult. How many of you will travel?
Me, my wife Penny and Johnny my son.
Fantastic. And could you tell me what your budget is?
1700, I wish I could spend more but I'm a writer and my last book was a total flop you know. I'm travelling to work on my book so if you could find places that were calm that would be really nice. I need this one to be a masterpiece!
Ok! Well sadly I cannot find you a package in Chicago for that budget, so perhaps you could tell me your other destination possibility and we can explore your options there.
Ok, the other place I was thinking of is Baltimore
For just a little more than your budget I can book you 13 days at the Countryside Inn. This would cost 1747.67USD for the three of you and you would be in Baltimore from Sept 2-14.
Is that the only option for Baltimore?
You could spend 8 days at the Countryside Resort in Baltimore for 1805.69USD.
Ok well I really need this getaway so I suppose an extra 50$ and 3 days won't hurt. Can you tell me more about the place?
Sure! It’s 3 stars, near a park for little Jonny, and has a guest rating of 8.69. The hotel has free wifi, free breakfast, and free parking as well :slightly_smiling_face:
Is it booked then?
I can go ahead and book it if you are ready!
Yes please!
Consider it done then :slightly_smiling_face:
Amazing, thank you! Now all that's left to do is for me to write a bestseller! And pack of course
I will need to confirm the number of people. Please state the total number of adults and the total number of children in your party.
5 adults and 5 children
Perfect. Could you confirm your dates of travel please.
I can go anytime!
Perfect. Would you have a preference concerning economy class seating or business class seating?
Business please
Perfect. Would you have a preference between a 10 day package or an 11 day package?
I have no preference. Either or is fine
Perfect.  Would you have a preference on a 3.5 star hotel or a 5 star hotel?
5 star for sure
Based on the information you have provided, the following would be my recommendation: The Emerald - 10 days, 5 star hotel, close to the airport, includes free parking. All passengers would travel via business class and depart Manaus destination Seattle on Tuesday Sept 6, returning on Wednesday Sept  14. Total price for this package is  22102.49USD. Is this satisfactory?
This is 100% satisfactory! I will have you book this package please!
Perfect! I will book that for you. Thank you and safe ravels.
Thanks!
How many people in your party - adults and children?
just me
do you have date preferences?
no
length of your stay please?
doesn't matter
and lastly do you have a budget in mind?
$7,500
Unfortunately, we do not have flights to Melbourne from Rio de Janeiro at the moment. May I check other destinations for you?
I'm leaving from Manaus
I apologize.  I meant from  Manaus.  No flights from Manaus to Melbourne.
okay well how about to Rome
I have 6, 7 and 12 day stays in Rome departing from Manaus. Anything special you are looking for in a hotel?
Nothing in particular but what are the best packages you can offer?
do you prefer to fly economy or business?
i prefer business
May I suggest the 6 day package at Hotel Grand Residence, a 4 star property located near shopping and the cathedral in Rome. This package includes free wifi and breakfast for 3770.52USD. As requested, flights are in business class seating departing Sept 2nd and returning Sept 6th. Would you like to proceed with booking?
Heck yes! That sounds like a great deal! Hook me up!
:+1: I will book that for you right away.
Thank you!
Where would you be leaving from?
From Tijuana and I would be going between August 31st and September 11th
Where would you like to go?
Let's check Burlington first
A 2.5 star hotel in the heart of the city would cost 958.49USD for a 6 day stay and you would have free wifi and free parking. For 6 days at a 3.0 star hotel near a park with free wifi you would be paying 1221.70USD.
Those are pretty good deals, are they with economy flights?
Yes, they are.
ok great, that's something I'm happy to save on
Any other destinations to check out?
Leon, since I could go to Burlington for about 1000, is there anything in Leon around the same price? And 6 days sounds like a good length
The cheapest package to Leon would be 2199.7USD.
Wow that would be quite a lot more, why the price difference? Is it a fancier hotel?
However, the hotel in Leon is 5 star and located on the beach near a palace.
How long is that stay?
8 days
Ok thanks. My friend lives in Punta Cana, how much would it cost to get there?
515 dollars for a 5 day stay.
What's the hotel like?
2.5 star
and...
On the beach.

I don’t understand. What do you mean?
What else can you tell me about this hotel?
It is called El Mar.

San Jose. My budget is 20900 too and we have no specific date for return
I also need to confirm return date as in your original statement you said it was Sept 2nd
yeah thats correct, I'm getting my plans all mixed up today. We would like to return on the 2nd
do you have specific destinations you would like me to verify?
no anywhere is fine
regrettably, I do not seem to have any departures out of San Jose
that's redonkulous. I'll go somewhere else then.
I am here to help you do that. What is your city of departure?
Washington
Any destinations in mind?
Kingston
what category hotel are you looking for and with which sorts of amenities included?
nothing in particular, just something under 1700
I have several options that suit your price range but the earliest we can get you on a flight is Sept 6th
thats fine as long as im back by the 15th
All of the options will get you back before the 15th.  Would you prefer to be located in the downtown core or near the museum?
downtown preferably
I have the Cosmos Inn available for 9 days from Sept 7 to the 15. It is located in the heart of the city and close to the park. Your package there would include free wifi, parking and breakfast, all for a pretty low price.
are there any other packages?
The price on the above package is  619.40USD.  I also have the Exalted Raven B&B at 679.82USD located near the museum.
I think I like the first price better so i'll have more money to shop teehee

yes please do
I have put your request through. Thank you for booking
Thank you
Hey! How about August 27 until August 31?
That's a bit short, anything longer? There is so much I want to see there :smile:
I don’t have any longer trips within your date range.

Sure :slightly_smiling_face: The hotel is 3.5 stars, called the Scarlet Palms Resort. Guests have given the hotel a 7.15/10 rating and the Scarlet Palms is located near shopping and a park. Your package includes free wifi, free breakfast, and free hotel parking. The total for this vacation package would be $2521.
Wow! Sounds so nice! It just feels like a lot of money for such a short trip. What if I traveled from september 8-16 instead?
I don’t have anything between those dates, however I could book you 10 days at the Scarlet Palms hotel from August 28 until September 6 for a cost of 3103.57USD
I have 6 days at the Sublime Tower from Sept 8-12. Would you like to hear more?
Does it cost less than 3500?

Great! Cheaper, but we don't need to be cheap really. And could you tell me what would be available in SF?
In San Francisco we only have 2 and 2.5 star hotels. Would these interest you or are you looking for a fancier stay like the ones I offered you in SL and Santo Domingo?
Yeah, not interested.. would only be in San Francisco to see in-laws anyway so I'll tell the old lady its all booked up except for a couple of dumps. I wanna book the SL 5 star - what is it close to ?
Unfortunately I do not have information about nearby attraction. Would you still like me to book it for you?

It is a 2.5 star hotel, so not as fancy as the previous one but satisfied customers have given it a 8.86/10 review and it is close to the beach.
That is exactly 2.5 stars below what a superstar of my stature deserves. Ok forget Montreal then. Can you get me into the swankiest hotel in Mannheim

Okay, glad I could help you explore some options. Have a nice day!
Thanks, you too
Are your dates flexible at all?
It just needs to be within that time period
would you prefer a 6 or 12 day stay?
12 days
I have a 2 star hotel available with free wifi departing on August 30 and returning on Sept 10. Total price on this 12 day package is $828.33USD. Is this of interest to you?
Its not bad. But I want to see if there's better options elsewhere Can you check, for the same parameters, Punta Cana?
For the record, that package is called the Muse. I will now proceed with your second request. To Punta Cana, Dominican Republic from Vitoria, Spain I have 15 day and 21 day stays open. Which would you prefer?
21 if it fits the dates I gave you. Whats the price?
That package departs on Sept 2nd returning on Sept 21. The total price for this 21 day stay including flights, is $1654.42USD. please note that there are no amenities included with this package.
Oh ok I might be able to put up with that. Ok let me ask about one last city: what you got for Curitiba?
A 12 day stay at the Crown Market Palace, located on the beach is $2113.27USD. This package includes all the amenities such as free wifi, breakfast and free parking.
Its cool how many options there are for my budget. Ok since the Punta Cana trip is the longest, I'll take that one
I will confirm your stay at the La Estrella del Mar for 21 days on an economy class flight for a grand total of 1654.42USD. We appreciate you using our services.
Wonderful
The most upscale hotel I can offer you is The Glee. Have you heard of it?
How many stars does it have
It has 4 stars, user reviews of 8.22/10, its close to a park and it offers free wifi and free breakfast to its guests.
Ok yes that sounds promising. What are the dates you can get me
I have an 8 day stay for you from September 8th to the 15th. If you prefer to leave on the 1st I have a 3.5 star hotel I could offer you instead.
No I want the better hotel. Actually on that topic. Could I get an even better hotel if I doubled my budget to 2000?
The Glee is the most luxurious hotel we have in that city.
I’m convinced, Book it
Glad to have been able to help you! I'll proceed with the booking. Enjoy the rest of the day!
I have several options for you. What is your budget and what kind of hotel are you looking for?
The best hotel. I've got $3300
The best one I can offer you is Hotel Kirei which has 4 stars and excellent reviews from past guests.
Is that the best one in Sendai at any price point?
With a higher budget I would have several hotels for you to choose from but they also have 4 stars.
Do any of them have higher user reviews than the Kirei?
No, the Oishi has slightly higher customer satisfaction.
Ok that sounds like the best choice then. What dates can you get me?
It's a day trip from September 7th to 15th.
I’d really like to get there earlier if possible.
For 3493.44USD I can get you an 8 day stay at the same hotel from September 2nd to the 8th. It's over the initial budget you gave me but would you prefer that?
Yes I think I can make that work. LEts do it
Excellent, I'll make sure to book it for you.
:+1:
Hi! How can I assist?
im in an empty office, once again. dreaming about alexandria. im south of the border in ciudad juarez. i havent got the ability to take any time off right now unfortunately, but ive got 5 thousand bucks saved up for when i can take time off. so whats available in alexandria for that price?
There's a 3 star hotel near a university. It includes free breakfast, wifi, and parking. The trip departs September 8th and returns on the 13th. Business class flight costs 1109.95 and economy costs 926.57.
not bad. but also not amazing 
i could always just take a trip for me i suppose… instead of visiting relatives..
where could i stay if i went to goiania
Scarlet Palms Resort. 3.5 star rating. Near a park and shopping. Amenities include free breakfast, wifi, and parking. Departure date is August 27th, return date is September 9th . Costs are 4653.52 for business class and 3598.52 for economy. Another package departs August 28th and returns September 15th. Costs are 4148.88 for business class and 3208.28 for economy.
i could splurge on business class :heart_eyes: so I take it Scarlet Palms resort is the only one you’ve got availabilities at ?
Yes.
hmm ok, ok. anything impressive in Brasilia?
Our best is at a 3.5 star hotel, Parallel Angel. Departing August 29th and returning September 8th. The hotel is near a park, beach, and theatre, with free breakfast wifi and parking included. The cost is 3983.20 for business class.
I love the sounds of that one thanks, its been a pleasure dreaming with you
I do not understand your question. I can only help you search a database for the best trip opportunities on-line. Therefore, I will require a departure and a destination.
How much would it cost to get two adults and a child from Monterrey to Paris for 14 days?
Could you please provide a desired departure date
Totally flexible. But I need to spend less than 4700
I will now look for packages under $4700 to Paris...I have found several but I am afraid that they do not meet your budget. I can continue to search for you if you provide me with new guidelines.
If Paris is a no-go, how about Kingston? Or just look into shorter trips for me
I have found a package that meets all you needs but it is only an 8 day package at the Cosmos Inn - in Kingston, Canada departing on Sept 8 and returning on Sept 15th. This package is available for the price of  $4142.76USD and includes unlimited wifi, parking and breakfast at no additional cost.
Wow that seems decent. Any chance I could book this but for a longer time period?
No it is only accessible for an 8 day or a 5 day stay.
Ok fair enough, that seems like my best option then
Would you like me to proceed with booking?
Yes
Your choice of package has been booked.
from washington to denver?
yeah, tahts right. ive got just under 6 grand in savings
Which dates^
no dates
I see. We have 9 days trips in 4 star hotel at 502.62USD, and 572.79USD in business tirp
wow, cheap! and i could get away from this for a week and a half how would trips look from here to Montreal? 
Where would you like to go?
Montreal ?
I have 7 days at 4 star hotel at 1256.84USD, or 1561.99USD in business clas
wow, not as expensive as i thought to fly across the country whats the hotel located near? whats the package include?
Free parking and free wifi
hm. and the location? whats it look like&gt;
Near market and mall.
ok. interesting i suppose is that the only hotel available
We also have a 2.5 star hotel with 8.86 guest rating that is near the beach. includes free parking, breakfast and wifi, @ 1561.71USD
ok.. so still very affordable. you know, another place ive dreamed of going since i was a small lad is japan. can you look at whats available in Osaka?
we have 10 days and 12 days trip at hotels ranging from 3.5 stars to 4 stars
can you tell me more about the 4 star hotle. how long would that trip be?
10 days at 5564.37USD, near park and museum
lovely. and what about the 12 day trip?
3 stars hotels at 3564.28USD or  4637.20USD in business class with free breakfast and free wifi
and is that hotel near anything of note?
near a museum
thanks!
budget?
Willing to splurge if its an attractive option!
Can you leave the 8th? We have a holiday to Naples that starts that day.
Yes that would be ideal actually
The package includes a stay at Courtyard Resort which boasts 3 stars and 8.8/10 for user reviews. It's in the heart of Naples and close to a museum. What do you think?
That sounds really good to me but I would like to weigh my options a little first. Do you have any other destinations to show me?
I can also suggest trips to Philadelphia and Chicago, but those only leave September 12th. Is that too late for you?
Lets hear about the trip to Philadelphia
Sure, this is a trip to Philadelphia, US. With this package you would stay at a 2 star Mirror Inn close to a museum and a park.
Thats alright but I’m a little disappointed with the hotel. Would Chicago offer a better one?
The hotel in Chicago has 2.5 stars. How fancy of a hotel are you hoping to stay at? And by that I mean how many stars?
I was hoping for something similar to the one in Naples. Ok thats fine though. How much would the Naples package cost?
2998.72USD with economy and  3862.24USD with business class plane tickets.
Ok book me for economy and lets call it a day
Sounds good! I will proceed with booking.
thank you kindly
How many people?
ahh. two
Nice! When would you like to leave and do you have a budget?
no budget darling. leave asap
The earliest package we have available leaves August 27th and returns August 30th. This is at Winter Arc, a 2.5 star hotel in the heart of Dallas and near a museum. The hotel also offers free breakfast and wifi. The business package costs 5554.80.
2.5 stars isnt going to do sadly. anything better, leaving shortly after?
This is the only hotel available. Do you have a different destination?
well, far less options available than your competitors.. strike one. i suppose tijuana would do as a destination
There are two hotels available, Resort Jade Covert which is a 3 star hotel, and Hotel Perfection which is 2.5 stars.
i could leave from london if need be..what would i be looking at then?
There is nothing more than 2.5 stars.
how tragic
Let me check that for you! No flights from Madrid to Santos.
and Ulsan?
No flights from Madrid to Ulsan.
wow
I'm afraid we do not currently have any available flights between those cities. Any other destinations I can search for you?
how bout puebla to fukuoka
You could stay for 10 days at the Oceanside Hotel for 6371.69USD.
is that a good hotel?
It depends what you are looking for. This one has 3.5 stars and is located in the heart of the city.
that is not a good hotel...is there a better one?
We do not have hotels with more than 3.5 stars in Fukuoka 
i guess we’ll have to settle for that... do you offer business class flights at least
Yes we do, with business class flights the package costs 8275.17USD.
ok thats more like it just so i can feel okay about my decision
what amenities at the hotel?
You will have free wifi.
and?
That is the only amenity offered by this hotel. If you would also want free breakfast I can offer you 10 days at Historic Mansion Hotel which is a 3.5 star hotel.
No thats the last straw, we are taking our business elsewhere
Hi. I regret to inform you that flights from San Jose to Queenstown are not provided with your packages.
How about Punta Cana
Flights to Punta Cana are not provided either. Any other places I can look up for you?

Not bad, how much it cost?
Would you prefer flight seats in economy or in business class?
Can I get business class for less than 5000?
Yes! With business class the 7 day package is 3781.35USD and the 6 day one is 4461.76USD.
Is the six day package at a better hotel?
They are at the same hotel.
Ok then as long as it fits in my dates then I’m ok with the 7 day package

Yes, please check for Puebla also

Is that 6 days?
Yes.
My coworker went to Monterrey and she told me it wasn't that great. I'll go if I have to but you got anything else?
We also have a 6 day trip at a 3 star hotel near a park and museum with a 9.32/10 guest rating and free parking, breakfast, and wifi to Fortaleza, Brazil. The business flight costs 1872.58 and is from September 1st to 7th.
I heard Fortaleza is overrun with hipsters. Got anything in Europe? I have very refined tastes you know
These are the only trips we have from Phoenix.
Fine I suppose I'll go to Monterrey
Alright! I will book this for you and you will receive a confirmation email soon! Safe travels!
Uh huh
When would you prefer to go?
Next week but I can wait if it means you get me a five star hotel
Our highest rated hotel in the database is a 3.5 star hotel.
Thats disgusting. How do I turn up at a 3.5 star hotel?
Ok look up Mannheim then
We have a 5 star hotel with a 8.98/10 guest rating near a park. Amenities include free wifi and a spa. This package is from September 4th to September 15th and business class which comes to a total of 27240.35.

Business class??
Yes
SL sounds good to us
I will book this for you!
:+1:
Good day, we are here to help you book your best trip possible. How can I help you today?
I've been rewarded with a company trip for me and some coworkers but the destination is a subject of conflict. Our parameters include the travel window being from August 30 until September 18
What destinations were you thinking of?
And we are looking at Osaka first of all. That would be for 6 adults, all leaving from Burlington
We have 2 choices in Osaka for 6 adults. The 4 star Aquamarine Majesty Hotel available for 13 days and the 3 star Hotel Opportunity available for 9 days. Any preference?
Those both sound very suitable. What would be the dates of travel for the Majesty Hotel
The Aquamarine Majesty Hotel is available from Sept 2nd to Sept 13. It is located by the park and museum and offers free wifi and free parking.
That sounds quite ideal. Just to appease some other difficult colleagues, what would be available in Mexico City for the same date range?
Lets search that for ... 2 adults
I have hotels available in Mexico City for 6 days and for 12 days. Do you prefer the 12 day stay?
Yes, please. The longer the better. What is the hotel like?
Your 12 day stay at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites, a 3.5 star rated hotel, will include free parking and free wifi. It is located near the beach and close to shopping. The dates of departure and return are Sept 2 to Sept 13.
Well, same dates for both.. ok.. I like both honestly. I guess lets see which package is cheaper. How much is the Majesty package in Osaka
The price for 6 adults at The Aquamarine Majesty Hotel is 19573.81USD. The price for 2 adults at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites in Mexico City is 2227.91USD.
That's great, thank you. Ok, so there are a lot of folks on my team I think...
Would both of these packages be available for 13 adults?
The Aquamarine Majesty has availability for 13 people at a cost of 42409.93USD. The Exalted in Mexico City also has availability for 13 at  14481.44USD.
I guess we should go with Mexico City as it is noticeably more affordable
Can you book that for me?
I will proceed with booking the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites in Mexico City for 13 people from September 2nd to September 13th, 2016. Confirmation will be sent to you shortly.
Thank you so much :smile: Can't wait!
I am really sorry but my database doesn't return any results ..
When would you like to leave?
Not picky with dates, but I hope soon!
Do you have a budget?
5400
Is there a different destination?
Calgary also works
There are no results for this either. Are you able to increase your budget?
Unfortunately not...I'm not exactly in good financial standing here Can you think of something here...I really need a trip
Do you have any other possible destinations in mind?
Those were the only two in mind. You got any other ideas?
We have trips to Sydney, Munich, Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo, and Kobe.
These are all under my budget?
yes.
Its rather curious that I can get to Sydney but not Calgary But I suppose thats not your fault In any case, can you give me more details?
For Sydney?
Correct
This is a 4 star hotel near a park, 8.86/10 guest rating, free breakfast, wifi, and parking, departing August 30th, returning September 7th, economy class seats, 5279.67.
Let me just ask about Munich also
The hotel in Munich is a 5 star hotel near a university, 0/10 guest rating, free wifi, departing September 6th, returning September 14th, economy seats, 4635.19.
0/10 guest rating???
Correct.
That is rather frightening Ok I'll ask my wife if Sydney is a suitable destination and get back to you 
but thanks for all your help, I feel much better now
No problem! Have a nice day!
You are leaving between sept 2 and 9?
I am leaving sept 2 and returning the 9 or within that time frame

I’m looking for a package to Leon
Perfect, where would you like to leave from?
Pittsburgh. I need a luxurious package.
How many people will you be and do you have some travel dates in mind?
1 adult i will leave sept first
and stay as long as I can for 3200
We have a highly rated 5 star hotel available with a Sept 1st departure. Are you interested in hearing more about this property?
I’m intersted in hearing more.
Serene Palms Resort is a 5 star resort with a 8.98/10 guest rating located on the beach and near the palace. I meant to say  that it is within your budget of $3200 at 2342.94USD if you go on economy  or 2980.38USD if you go on business class for a nine day stay.
What else would be available there? I just wanna make sure I’m booking the best place...
It is indeed. One of our highest rated hotels in Leon. I also have the highly rated Hotel Sunny Aurora, also a 5 star property, but this one is not available before Sept 8.
Hmmmm I certainly hope its not booked up by the party who I’m tracking... I’ll just chance it and go with the Palms anyway. I’m sure 5 stars in Leon will find me some face of note
Does the Sept 1st departure with a return date of Sept 9th work for you? Would you prefer to be booked into economy or business class?
Lets do business - maybe I’ll luck out sitting next to Madonna on the plane
I will now proceed with the booking.  Thank you and have a wonderful day.
Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
Hello! How can I help you today?
I just need to dream a bit... I have 4500 dollars but no vacation days. I'm wondering what a hypothetical trip to Manaus would be like

I'm in Tijuana, not departing any time soon unfortunately though
Not a problem - how many would you be traveling with?
Just me
I'm sorry, but we unfortunately do not have any results for these flights? Would you like to try a different destination?
That's fine, what about Curitiba/
That I do have! Would you be satisfied with a 3.5 star hotel?
As of now I'm be satisfied with a tent and a backpack. What are the hotel details?
The hotel is situated near a park, and comes with free parking, wifi, and breakfast! Does this sound good to you?
Sounds quite nice, what about the guest rating?
The guest rating is impressive: 8.86/10.
Impressive indeed
Sounds like a great package. What about in Kyoto? I would like to hear about the options there as well
Definitely! In Kyoto, I can get you a 9 day stay in a hotel near the heart of the city, and a museum. How does that sound?
That sounds like a stimulating trip. Could you remind me how long the stay in Curitiba would be?
It would be entirely up to you! Choices are 8, 13, and 14 days.
What is the rating of the Kyoto hotel?
That would be 3 stars,
And the guest rating?
A respectable 6.61/10
Neato! Well if I had the time off available I would definitely book Curitiba
Is this 5 adults or are there children as well?
all adults
Where are you leaving from?
Oops sorry totally forgot to tell you! Santos

Can you also let me know some other options for Toronto so I can compare?

That works! Can you book it for me?
Sure! It is booked and you will receive a confirmation email soon! Have a great day!
Awesome thanks!
You can go to Puebla, for one, where you will be staying 17 days at the Grand Brewery Mexico from September 2 to 17. Thoughts?
oh i need to travel from sept 8 until 13
How about the Echo in La Paz, from September 8 to 13?
could be good - what are the details of the hotel
4 stars with a sterling 8.98/10 guest rating, perhaps because it offers a full suite of amenities: free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi.
what is the price?
For one adult, the price is 2615.94USD.
its perfect! i would like to book it
Done! It was a pleasure working with you today :slightly_smiling_face:
ok thank u
It will all depend on where you are leaving from. To confirm, that will be 2 adults and 3 kids?
Correct yes, and we will leave from Recife.
From Recife to Kingston there is nothing available. Could I search other packages for you?
Ahhh ok, maybe try Phoenix. If perhaps the problem is my budget, lets just up it by another thousand dollars.
Did you have some dates in mind?
Yes, we have a wide stretch of possible vacation days from September 13th until October 3rd
Travel packages are not available to Phoenix from Kingston for 2 adults and 3 children during those dates and for that budget. I regret I cannot make possible suggestions, but i can check other destinations for you.
Well what about in Goiania.?
Nothing, I apologize.
I can help with that! Where would you like to go?
Brasilia perhaps. My spouse and child will travel with me.. so three of us in total.
Great. Where would you be flying out of?
Also, my budget is tight.. I haven't had a good year and can spend about 4000 but would like to stay for 9 days. Leaving from Mexico City
You're in luck: I have exactly what you might be looking for! 9 days at the prestigious Sublime Tower, from September 10 to 17. How does that sound?
That sounds quite ideal.. what would the cost be?
For one adult, 3558.40USD for business class, and 2794.59USD for economy class.
Two adults, one child. I thought I made it clear before that there would be three of us.
Unfortunately, I do not have trips to Mexico City for this parameter which fits under this budget. Would you like to consider leaving some guests behind, or searching for an alternate destination?
I absolutely would not leave my family behind... a little ridiculous for you to suggest that.. However, I would consider going to Paris
Unfortunately, we do not have a trip to Paris for the given parameters.
Not if we travel for 8 days either?
The cheapest trip we have to Paris is 6725.50USD, albeit at a very nice 4 star hotel!
Ah jeez, still out of my price range though. Well thanks but no good.
Where are you leaving from?
Santos
Do you have a budget?
Well, I kind of want to see what hotels you have first. My budget can change a bit based on the options
How many people are travelling?
Just myself
Would you like a 3 star hotel or a 4 star hotel?
For sure I want the best you've got
Our very best package is a 4 star hotel, 10/10 guest rating, near a park and museum, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 3rd to 14th, the business class package is 3015.77 and the economy package is 2362.11.
Okay that hotel sounds good! Sorry I forgot to tell you my dates: I can leave Friday September 2nd or later. Are those prices for a week?
The prices are from September 3rd to 14th.
Can I spend a bit more to stay longer?
This is the longest package there is.
I'll take it!
Great! I'll book this trip and then send you confirmation! Have a nice day!
Perfect, thanks!
Perfect, where will you be travelling to and what city would you like to depart from?
Leaving from St. Petersburg Destination Punta Cana!
Number of people?  Adults and kids.
Just 1 adult
Did you have a budget in mind?
Not exactly. I want to compare a few different options.
From St. Petersburg to Punta Cana, I have no available packages. Are your dates flexible, by any chance?
my dates aren't too flexible unfortunately, but I have a few other destinations in mind, Can you check for Kobe?
I have a 6 day package available to Kobe from St. Petersburg during those dates.  The Resort Ancient Angel is a 3.5 star hotel and the Royal Island Inn is a 3 star located near the market and the palace. Do either one of these interest you?
What are the main difference between the two hotels?
There's not a huge difference. One is a 3 star the other a 3.5 star. The 3.5 star Resort Ancient Angel has a guest rating of 8.69/10 and is available from Sept 6th to the 10th whereas the 3 star Royal Island Inn has no guest ratings yet and is available from Sept 1st to the 5th. They both include free wifi. The 3.5 star Resort Ancient Angel is about $600 more for a 6 day stay.
Can you help me check for options in Miami?
The Majestic Island Inn & Suites  is our only option in Miami. It is a 3.5 star rated hotel with a guest rating of 8.8/10 and is open for a 7 day stay. Wifi, parking and breakfast are included.
How many days is this package?
7 days for the price of  1008.99USD if you travel via economy class
Lastly can you help me check for Valencia?
In Valencia, I have 2 choices for your stay. Stardust Hotel which has a 4 star rating or The Gold  which has a 5 star rating. Both are available for a 7 day stay.
Can you tell me a bit more about these hotels?
The Stardust Hotel has an excellent guest rating of 9.32/10 and includes free wifi. It is located near the museum and is priced at 2378.72USD. The Gold - 7 days also has an excellent guest rating of 8.98/10, includes free wifi  and is priced at 2358.99USD.
What will be the travel dates for these two packages?
The flights on both these packages are the same - Sept 6 to Sept 11 and the flights are available in both economy or business class.
Can you let me know the costs for the two Kobe packages?
Royal Island Inn is 2837.59USD and the Ancient Angel  is 3408.83USD. Pricing is based on economy class flights.
And the Valencia prices you gave me earlier are also based on economy flights?
Yes they are.
I will go with the Stardust Hotel in Valencia. Can you confirm the booking?
I will process the booking for the Stardust hotel in Valencia from sept 6 to Sept 11 and send you an email confirmation. Thank you for your patience and have a lovely day.

For one person? Any travel dates in mind?
Nope, I wish! I will be dragging 4 other adults with me. No set dates specifically..
It seems we have no flights out of Tel Aviv. Can I search other departure cities for you?

When would you like to travel?
Our dates are flexible.

I would prefer the longer packages, but my budget total is 8300.

Are there any other options or is this it?

Well ok.. what else is there for me in terms of destinations?
A beachfront resort in Brasilia awaits you...namely 10 days at the Sublime Tower! :beach_with_umbrella:
awesome!! What does the hotel have to offer?
In addition to being near a beach, it is also in close proximity to shopping and theatres. Amenities are stacked: free wifi, breakfast, and parking.
And the rating?
3.5 stars, 8.69/10 from its legions of satisfied guests!
Not too shabby at all.
So far that's got my eye above the others. Before I book it, are there any other trips available in my parameters that have a 4.5 or 5 star hotel?
Am I to understand that you have an unlimited budget?
Well I mean I'm not rolling in dough but I'm splurging here
How about the Hotel Oishi in Hiroshima? 4.5 stars, 8.86 guest rating, and near the museum.

Well, I have a budget of 9700. Which would fit in my budget zone?
The cheapest option in Sacramento for that many people is Salt Water Inn at 15399.53USD, so Sacramento is not within your budget.
How about Rio de Janeiro?
Nothing is available in Rio de Janeiro. I can try to see if I can get some options by making your dates flexible. Would you like me to try?
My dates are not exactly flexible.
However, I have a third destination in mind.
Maybe I'll have better luck with Vancouver?
No Vancouver is not available either.
Okay fine let's make the dates flexible and see if we can find something.
It still did not yield results, any other destinations I could check for you?
Nothing for Rio de Janeiro either?
Nothing to Rio de Janeiro either.
Would you see if there's anything cheaper for Sacramento if the dates are made flexible?
I am no longer showing packages form Sendai to Sacramento, I am sorry everything must have booked up. Please come again.
That's unfortunate! I think I will have a discussion with my wife again. We might need to change our preferred destinations. I will contact you again once we reach a decision. Regardless, thanks for your help!

I won 3300 on the slots and would like to go to Kobe
Cool! Do you have any dates in mind?
I'm available from September 12 to the 26th

We have a few options for you. Do you have a certain amount of money to allocate to this trip?
that’s the thing… I only made about 1200 on my last book
$1200 will not cover any of our 9 day packages in Burlington, perhaps we can lower the amount of days?
ah, yeah sure.. first can you see if it would buy 9 days in Phoenix?
No there is nothing available in Phoenix for that rate at all.
oh dear.. ok well just see if there’s anything in Burlington for a lower date range
The lowest I have in Burlington is 2056.86USD, on a 9 day package. Are you able to raise your budget a bit?

We all got September 6 to 26 blocked off
Any destination in mind?
What would a trip to Kingston look like?
I’ve got a couple options in Kingston for you. To help me narrow them down, could you provide me with a budget for your trip? Or perhaps a desired length of stay?
We have 27100 between the 7 of us. Whats the longest trip you can find?
The longest trip would be 9 days. You would be staying at the Cosmos Inn, a 2.5. star hotel with a 6.37 guest rating; it is near a park in the heart of the city.
I'm sure we can do better! Can we go to Hamburg then?
Would you like a higher hotel rating?

tell us more about the 4 star
The Traveller Inn has free breakfast and free wifi. It has been well received by guests with its 8.69 user review rating.
Thats not bad. Wait could you find a better hotel in Kingston tho?
I can offer a 3.5 star hotel near a museum for 8 days in Kingston?
Would that cost more or less than the 10 days at the Traveller?
That would cost 10269.29USD, while the Hamburg package would cost 20741.24USD.
Wow lets go with that then, the difference in pricing is astronomical
Certainly! I will book the Kingston package for you all.
hello there
Could you book me a flight from Belem to Punta Cana?
One adult?
2 adults
Do you have a set date of departure?
No date of departure for this trip, but I would prefer earlier if possible
The earliest I have is Sept 2nd, how does that sound? That package would put you in Punta Cana for 16 days. Do you have a cap on how much you want to spend?
That should work. I actually don’t for this trip. But can you keep it to something reasonable, like under 6100?
This particular package on economy class flights is 4289.9USD. Do you want more details on the hotel?
is it near the airport?
It is near the cathedral and the palace. In Punta Cana, I have nothing near the airport available.
Thats fine, lets just go with that

My budget is 2700 by the way
I can offer you a 13 day package from Washington for only $493.

The Winter Hill Inn is near a park, mall, and theatre!
Then I will take it!
Alright, you're booked

That was easy! thanks
I’m sorry, I cannot find anything within your budget.
Preposterous. 3500 then

I'll take the business package then. Please confirm the booking.
Of course. You will receive a confirmation email shortly.
Cool, thanks!
Leaving Sao Paulo?  It seems like we have no flights out of Sao Paulo.
Denver to Mexico City... for one?
yup
For as long as possible?
for whatever 5400 can buy me
Does 11 days on a beach at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites sound like something you are dreaming of?
Its as if you can read my mind! How many stars they have?
It has 3.5 stars and is also close to shopping.
And the amenities?
free parking should you require a car and free wifi
cool. what are my options to rio de janeiro
My best hotel in Rio de Janeiro is the La Perfección for an 8 day stay, 3 star, breakfast is included and you have a parking spot and wifi at no charge.
Could I find anything like it in Ulsan?
I have 5 star hotels in Ulsan, but none of them include all of the amenities.
Thats fine
Then I can offer you the 5 STAR The Sapphire Time close to the park, market and theatre, this seems to be the most expensive hotel in Ulsan and is available for 10 days at  4277.25USD. For this one you would have to fly economy though. If you wanted to stay five days only but fly business, we could do that too for just a bit more money.
Ahh there it is. Thats all I needed today, thanks
Come again!
I’m sorry, I don’t have any flights available for you.
What would happen if i tried jerusalem to portland instead?
I’m sorry, I have nothing available out of Jerusalem.
cool, THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!
Where will you be leaving from?
Santo Domingo
Where do you want to go?
Punta Cana is one of the option.
Do you have a budget?
It'd be sweet to spend less than 3100
When would you like to leave?
We can leave on or after Sep 2
There's a 2.5 star hotel near the beach, the cost is 1661.32 and is from September 10th to 19th with business class flights.
Do you know the guest rating of this hotel?
0/10
That's not ideal. Do you have any other options for Punta Cana?
This is our very best option.
I see. Can you check for trips to Phoenix then?
We have a 3 star hotel near a museum and university, 6.91 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 9th to 19th, business class flights, price is 2967.70.
And that is also the best option you have?
Yes.
Okay that's simple. I'll book the Phoenix trip!
Alright! Have a great day!
Thanks for your assistance!
I sure do! When do you want to travel?
ASAP, but otherwise dates are flexible
budget is 3800
Great! I have a package leaving on August 31 until September 11. The cost is 2157 dollars
Oh nice I’m just going to check my other travel options for something cheaper
such as…Santos to Hamburg?
There is nothing cheaper.
Now if I really wanted to pinch pennies, I could also just travel to St. Louis instead
From Santos?
From Seattle
You could go from August 31st to September 16th for $532, at a 5 star hotel!
That is dirt cheap! I could just splurge on my meals instead. What kind of hotel do you have?
As in, tell me more about the 5 star
5 stars, as I said.
Amenities?
Free breakfast and free wifi are included.
Ok lets do that
Ok! I’ll book it for you.
Thanks!
Ok! Where would they leave from?
MonTErrey
Sure! Budget?
I got 2200 in my piggybank
I can send them to SL for 15 days from Sept 4-18. The cost for this package would be $2089.
Ok say no more fam. You book it yet?
No- would you like me to?
Hurry up and do it, idiot!
Just finished - all booked
Ok :+1: we out
Where from? How many people are travelling? What is your budget? When do you want to leave?
I'm traveling from Belem by myself. Budget's set at 3900. I have to travel between 9/1 and 12. These dates are not flexible.
Our best package is a 2.5 star hotel near a park and museum, 8.22/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 2nd to 8th, business flight, price is 2856.29.
Any other options?
No.
Alright then. I'll take it.
Great! Have a nice day!
Ok! Would you lke to go anywhere in particular?
Munich
Sure! I have September 10-17 available at a 5 star hotel in Munich. The price is $2853 for this package. Are you interested?
That interests me very much. What can you get me if I opted for Leon instead?
I have a 9 day trip at a 5 star hotel near a market. You could travel from September 8-14 or 12-20 and stay at the Sunny Aurora Hotel with prices ranging from 1660.82 USD to 2293.25 USD.
Those are so similar, I’m still having trouble deciding! What amenities are to be had in Leon?
Sunny Aurora Hotel in Leon has free wifi.
how about munich?
Also free wifi.
Is the hotel near anything interesting?
The Munich hotel is near a university.
I’m just going to flip a coin on this one...Ok Munich it is
I will book your stay in Munich :slightly_smiling_face:
How much would I pay if I wanted to go business class?
Business class flights would bring your total to 3804 USD
Yes please get that for me.
OK, done!
Soonest departure is tomorrow August 31st.  We have a 5 star hotel available: The Sapphire Time as well; as well as a 5 star hotel Escape Cave. Same departure and return. Can you please give me an indication of how much you have to spend?
We have 3700
Those are way out of your range. The best I can do is offer you a 7 day package in Ulsan at the Grandiose Willow Resort for just $188 over your budget at a total of 3888.76USD. This is a 2.5 star hotel near the park and the university offering free parking and free wifi.
What if we toned down the ambition and tried Munich instead?
Munich has a spectacular deal at the 5 STAR Regal Bluff for 10 days at 775.0USD, wifi included.
Nothing for longer??
No, 10 days is the longest
Lets do it then
I will take care of that for you right away. Happy Honeymooning.
Thank you!
Sure! Where would you like to go?
I haven't really thought about it. Can you give me some options that are within my budget?
Sure. When would you like to travel?
Hopefully between August 31 and September 5

Do you have an alternate departure point? Sadly we do not offer San Francisco flights directly to Vitoria
I will follow your directions to a tee. Please provide your dates, number of people travelling together, and your parameters in what you desire in a hotel - star, amenities, location etc., whether you would like to fly economy or business and the total length of your stay  :grinning:
Whenever, by myself, 5 star hotel, all of the above, don't care, business, whatever. IN THAT ORDER

Great! Have a splendid trip!
Thanks! Much appreciated.
Sorry, to Campinas or to San Juan?
to San Juan
Sure!  I can offer 13 days for 10747 dollars!
I almost had a panic attack when I saw that price tag. No, I need a trip for 5800 or less

The Ebony Manor Inn & Suites is a 4 star property with a 8.22/10 guest rating. This one also includes all the amenities that the Lethargy Hotel. If you want only the best, the price is 1571.49USD via business class tickets.

Unfortunately there are no results.

There are no results for this either.
Ok! So that’s 2 adults, 2 children?
Rumours abound of a croissant so good, whoever eats it enters into an state of absolute grace. I must find this product and sell it at my St. Petersburg bakery. yeah, you know. 
Are you leaving from St. Petersburg?
I am
And are you travelling with a budget?
8800 USD
And would you prefer to stay at a 4 star hotel or an unrated facility?
4 stars please
Ok! I have the Hotel Emerald Legacy for 6 days at a price point of $7986
What are the amenities? Bruce is a baby about these things
Hotel Emerald Legacy has free breakfast and free wifi, as well as a guest rating of 8.22/10.

Nothing.
Monterrey then? In this case we'll be going 7 adults total.
There are no avialabilities.
Unbelievable...Tofino is my last option
There are no results for this either.
I guess this is going to work
I’m sorry, we don't
It sure is! When would you like to travel?
Anytime after our wedding
I can offer 12 days, with business class flights and a 4 star hotel, for 1007 USD

You really think of everything, don’t you?
Where will you be leaving from?
Departing from Marseille
How many people are you?
I'm traveling solo
When do you want to leave?
I don't really care. My budget is 4400 though. Surprise me.
There are no results, surprise!
Okay maybe I don't like surprises that much after all... How about Cairo?
There's a 2.5 star hotel.
Anything else?
No.
Fine Tell me about this 2.5 hotel
They have a 8.22/10 guest rating, park, market, cathedral, palace, free parking, breakfast, and wifi.
Now that doesn't sound so bad after all!
Want to book it?
Why not
Great! Have a nice day!
Thanks!
Yes, indeed I can! Where would you be leaving from?
I live in Munich.
Unfortunately we do not fly directly from Munich to Kabul. Is there an alternate destination that I could arrange for you?
You've got nothing else?
I’m sorry  - nothing :disappointed:
Where would you like to leave from and where would you like to go?
We would be setting off from Burlington. We would be looking to land in Toronto.
Burlington to Toronto for 1 adult and 3 children.  I have several options.  Would you prefer to stay in Toronto for 8 or 12 days?
I would prefer a longer trip, please! However, it behooves me to make mention of my 3300 budget for this voyage.
Most everything I have in Toronto for September is under your $3300 dollar budget. For a 12 day stay, the Hotel Eric Perrier is priced at $2441.0USD and has a 4 star rating. It also has an excellent guest rating of  8.8 / 10.
I would like to know if this hotel offers any amenities?
Daily breakfast is part of the package, as well as wifi. If you wanted to travel by business class with the children, the price would be 2863.7USD, still below your budget.
Can you also be so kind as to check for tickets to Philadelphia?
I have one package available in Philadelphia, but unlike Toronto, I only have a 5 day package.  The Mirror Inn is priced at 2498.21USD and has a 2 star rating. The guest rating on this hotel is 6.61/10
Understood. I would like to submit an application for the Toronto package, for the economy seat option. But before I do, can you remind me of the dates?
You would depart Burlington on September 8th at 11am and return on September 19 at 3am.
The return flight is past the children's bedtime. Do you have any other selections?
That is the only flight available from Burlington to Toronto on that day.
Very well. Please book this trip for me, thank you.
I will go ahead with the booking for you. Safe travels.
Thank you
Sorry, no. 
Hey :slightly_smiling_face: Would you like to book a trip?
I need your help to plan the dream vacation for me and my grandson! My grandson has always wanted to visit Porto Alegre.
Ok! Where would you depart from?
We're both at Toluca.
Ok! So am I correct in believing there will be one adult and one child in total?
You're smart!
Great :slightly_smiling_face: I will get searching for you immediately. Do you have a budget in mind for your trip?
Let me know if 3200 will be enough
And have you got any time constraints for your vacation? Is there a date you would like to leave? A date you need to return home by?
We can leave any day on or after September 2. But we have to get back before September 12
Sadly I can’t find anything from Toluca to Porto for one man and one child that costs less than 3200 dollars… would there perhaps be an alternate destination in mind? Or maybe a higher budget you would be willing to work with?
I was actually thinking of Toronto...
Ok! You’re in luck - I have ONE package left to Toronto within your parameters, and I think it sounds perfect for you! You would depart on September 2nd, and leave Toronto on the eleventh. You’d be staying at the 4 star Hotel Eric Perrier, located near a cathedral and just a few short strides from the airport. You would be treated to free breakfast throughout your stay and have access to free wifi for the duration of your trip. The guest rating is an impressive 8.8/10 and the cost of the package is well within your budget at $2648.63.
And we'll have economy seats I assume?
Yes, that’s correct.
Well, I guess this Toronto package ain't too bad...
:slightly_smiling_face: Would you like me to book it?
That's wonderful, please do!
Consider it done
Thank you my dear!
Sure! From where would like to depart?
Berlin. And get me back by Sept 14
Ok! Are you travelling alone?
no im bringing my boo, so there'll be two of us
Ok! Are you travelling with a budget?
no, no budget
Great :slightly_smiling_face: I have a 10 day trip to Kochi at a 3.5 star hotel for 4050 dollars. How does that sound?
get us a better hotel
I’m sorry, but I have nothing higher than 3.5 stars in my search results.
ok fine how about atlanta
I have a lovely 3.5 star hotel on the beach in Atlanta with free wifi and parking!
Welcome. Yes we do, we specialize in travel packages.
then get me from columbus to sapporo. dates don't matter but see if you can do it for under 3900
I have no travel  packages from Columbus to Sapporo. May I check other destinations?
you got any flights to kobe instead?
I have several packages in Kobe available for under 3900. Would you prefer to remain in Kobe 12 or 15 days?
15 days? what kind of hotel would that be
That would be the Royal Island Inn, close to the market and the palace. The accommodations are 3 star and wifi is provided free of charge.
what do other guests think of this place?
The guest rating is 0/10, but that may just mean that the hotel has not been reviewed by guests yet.
are there any other choices?
There are a couple of 12 day options, the Resort Ancient Angel, a 3 star rated hotel with a guest rating of 8.69/10  or 12 days at the White Square, a 3.5 star rated hotel with a guest rating of 6.91/10.
Does the first option have any amenities?
The first one provides free wifi whereas the second provides free wifi and breakfast
is that second one near anything cool?
I have no information as to the location of the first hotel but the White Square is located near a park.
lets go with that then. i need my free breakfast
Would you prefer to be booked on economy or business class flights?
what does the business class package cost?
It is priced at 3585.81USD. The flight departs on September 8th and returns on September 18th.
what about economy
Economy is priced at 2781.12USD with the same departure and return.
lets do that then. i need to save up to splurge on all that good food
You are now booked on economy class flights from Columbus to Kobe. Have a pleasant stay.
thanks thanks
Hi there, I can certainly help you with that.
I live in Brasilia so i need to fly out from here. I only have 2200.
Unfortunately we do not have any availabilities. Would you have an alternative destination or departure city?
Do you have anything to Sao Paulo?
Yes I do have a few options for Sao Paulo! We've got one 2 star hotel with a 6.91/10 guest rating. We also have two 3 star hotels, with guest ratings of 6.91/10 and 5.14/10. Is there anything you are looking for specifically in your choice of hotels?
hmmm.... i think the 3 star hotel with 6.91/10 guest rating sounds good. What is that hotel close to?
That is an excellent choice! That hotel is located at the heart of the city, close to a cathedral and a theater.
Does the hotel have free wifi?
You bet! It also offers free breakfast.
Yum! This hotel is sounding pretty dope. How much is the package?
We have a 4 day economy package for $911.52 leaving September 12, and a 6 day economy package with a slight increase of price at $958.90 leaving September 13. If you are interested, we also have a 6 day business package with the same dates for $1157.39.
What are the dates for the 6 day business package?
It is from September 13 to 18.
That sounds great! I'm down, book me this package please :slightly_smiling_face:
Okay, you are all set! Hope you have a great time at Sao Paulo :slightly_smiling_face:
Thank you!

I would like to go from Athens to Ulsan

Our budget is 6700. Not a penny more.
I’m sorry, it seems I cannot accommodate a child on that budget. I can find you something if just two adults are travelling?
Burlington.
I’m sorry, but I cannot get you from Athens to Burlington on 6700 dollars.
Then I will not be making use of your services.
Sorry :disappointed:
How can i help you today?
do you offer flights from san jose to buenos aires?

Nothing available.

Ok! I have the Glee from Sept 8-16 available. The hotel is 4 stars and near a park.

Hello!
BUSINESS class
Okay. When would you like to leave? Do you have any budget in mind?
A superstar is not concerned with budgets. Just get me there whenever
How many days would you like to stay in Punta Cana?
Just get me a good hotel
I'm afraid the best hotel in Punta Cana is 2.5 stars with a guest rating of 0/10. There might be better hotels in another city if you're open to other destinations.
I’d rather go to Phoenix then
The best in Phoenix is a 3 star hotel with 6.91/10 guest rating. If this sounds better to you, we have business packages available.
I think I have to go back to Punta Cana. Can you make me feel a little better about this potential choice by telling me what the amenities are?

Ok I think I want to narrow it down to this one or Ulsan Can you give me more detail on that hotel?
Absolutely! The hotel in Ulsan is close to a market and a palace. It offers free wifi and parking. In the past, guests have rated it 7.06/10. The 14 day package costs 3553.83. We also have a business package available for this option if that's something of interest to you.
this is also very attractive I think since we can afford rome, I’m leaning more to that
Feel like it would be more culturally different than what we’re used to
I agree with you. Would you like me to book it for you?
Please book it
Consider it done!
Thank you
Yes, where would you like to go?
i was thinking you could help me answer that. if i have 3100 to spend
Sure, do you have a budget?
and want to leave between sept 3 and 22. where could i go
You can go to Ulsan, Sendai, Sao Paulo, Kobe, Kyoto, or Montreal.
wow thats more options than i had imagined could i get a four star hotel in ulsan?
I can do you one better with a 5 star hotel in Ulsan! How does that sound?
that sounds incredible! how many days?
15, from the 3rd to 21st of September!
what kind of amenities do they have??
They have free parking and wifi, they are also near a park, market, and theatre!
I don't even care what the other cities have to offer, I'm just going to go with this one
Alright! The hotel has a 8.98/10 guest rating and this package is 2473.96. Unfortunately there is no business class option for this package so you will be flying economy. Would you like to book this package?
I'm ok with that!

What is the guest rating for this hotel?
Guests have rated it 6.77/10 on average.

Thats awesome! Lets book it economy class
Just for yourself?

Perfect. It will be 881.87 for the 11 day economy package. I will book it for you?

We are in Seoul. As much as I would like to just stick them on a plane on their own, I 'll have to go too! There are 5 little hellions and me. This flight is going to be a nightmare!
I have two different 5 star hotels available for your stay! Would you like to travel between the 8-14 or the 3-13?
The sooner the better, they are driving me nuts! First she pops out 5 kids, and then she leaves them with me :tired_face:

Thats good enough for me!

Ok! Where would you like to go?
San Juan. I heard it's cooler there. 
I have availability at the Fairyland from Sept 8-13. This hotel is 4 stars with a 8.98/10 guest rating. Its close to a museum, shopping, and market. The hotel also has free wifi for guests.
Wow that sounds awesome! How much?
2499.35USD for this seven day package.
Thank you please reserve that for me, I'm so excited!
Yes, you’ve got it. Enjoy your stay.
Sure! Leaving from where?
London, England. Way too much paparazzi here. It's like a wolf den.
I have 11 days at a 2.5 hotel near a park for 1290.36USD in Tijuana, Mexico. This package departs from London, Canada.
Is it a 5 star? I'm travelling with my diva friend and she won't settle for anything but the absolute best. Find us a spa or something.
As I said, this hotel is 2.5 stars. There is also the Resort Jade Covert available with a 3.0 star rating.
5 stars only for my girlfriend and I.
There are no 5 star hotels in Tijuana that I can find for you.
Burlington then. 5 stars only.
Once again I have only 2.5-3 star hotels.
That just won't do. What if I leave from Denver instead? Anything better in Tijuana?
Still just 2.5 or 3 star hotels, sadly.
In Burlington?
Below 3 stars.
You know, I'm just gonna have my assistant take care of this, she'll get me a beautiful retreat with a spa and guards to keep the paparazzi away.  Good riddance, whatever the hell your name is!
Goodbye!
We do! Do you have a budget in mind?
No budget! Find me something snazzy
Well, we have a trip to Leon, Tijuana, Rosario, Maceio, and Punta Cana!
What kind of hotel in Leon!
It is a 5 star hotel near a market
what are the amenities?
A spa!
What are the dates for this package?
September 24th to October 4th.
Would you be able to offer free breakfast to enjoy by the spa?
Unfortunately the hotel does not accommodate for free breakfast
how much would i be paying then, if breakfast isn't even included
2153.39 for economy class flights or 2729.19 for business class flights
I see. Can you check if there's a good hotel in Tijuana as well?
Priority goes to the ones that offer free breakfast!
This has a 2.5 star hotel near a park, 6.77/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 18th to 28th. The business class package is 1542.79 and the economy class package is 1229.30.
Free breakfast is a big plus, but I'm a little iffy on the stars. Whats on offer in Rosario?
I think you will like this one. It is a 4 star hotel close to shopping hot spots, 8.86/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 18th to 28th also, business class package comes to 3104.39, and the economy package comes to 2418.78.
You're right! Its quite ideal. I've already been to Punta Cana so that's not a destination I'd consider, but can you just quickly check Maceio for similarly attractive hotels?
This is a 3.5 star hotel close to a park, market, and theatre, 8.8/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 17th to 27th, business package costing 3680.67, and economy package costing 2868.83.
In that case I think the one you gave me in Rosario is best!
Would you like to book for business class or economy?
In fact, I think I'm ready to book
Business or economy?
Economy please
Great! Your flights are booked and you will get an email confirming your bookings! Have a great day and thank you for booking!
thanks!
I am very sorry to hear that. Where are you leaving from? Where would you like to go?
I've been backpacking around the world for 3 months and now I'm in Vitoria.
Where do you need to get to?
Mexico City. I need to leave on or after September 16.
ok! Have you got a travel budget?
I got $3000 left to my name, that's why it's crucial I get home and deal with the insurance company!
The only result I’m getting is a 15 day package to Mexico City for 2504.13USD. You would leave on September 20th. Is that ok?
I guess that would work. Nothing sooner?
Sorry - that’s the best I can do.
What if I leave from Rio de Janeiro instead?
The soonest I can get you out of Rio de Janeiro is also the 20th of September.
What if I leave from Vitoria and go to Cancun instead?
Once again, I have trips only on September 20th.
And from Rio de Janeiro to Cancun?
September 20th or 21st.
The original 15 day package to Mexico City, what hotel is it at?
Hotel Tropic, a 3 star hotel on the beach.
Well I guess I'll  take it, the insurance should reimburse me and 15 days gives me enough time to find another home.
I’ll go ahead and book that for you :slightly_smiling_face:
Thank you!
Unfortunately no. Are you able to depart from elsewhere?
I can’t!!!
Sure can! You can go for as long as 11 days.
Would it be at an upscale hotel?
I wouldn't say so. It's a 2 star hotel, although it has 6.61/10 average client rating.
Alright. Lets try another place: Kocchi
That's not a bad choice! With your money you can stay 8 days at a 3.5 star hotel and 12 days at a 2.5 star hotel.
Is the 3.5 star hotel near anything of note?
Are you kidding? It's in the heart of the city and next to a park!
Why would I be kidding? I did not expect to come here and get insulted by a bot. ok you know what
indianapolis also seems like it’d be cool
It is very cool! With you budget you can go there for 10 days in a 2.5 star hotel.
2.5 stars? how are the guest ratings then?
Not bad. It's rated 6.37/10 on average.
Thats it for today, thank you
You're welcome! Have a nice trip back to real life!
And from where will you be departing?
Berlin
I have 15 days at the Relaxation Hotel for  576.46USD.
How many people is this for?
are you travelling alone?
no
How many are in your party?
My wife, my lawyer, me and my 5 kids
In that case, the cost of the Relaxation Hotel package increases to 3510.67USD
What can we do at the Relaxation Hotel, this is an information gathering mission but I would like to spend some quality time with the kids
It is near a palace, has free wifi, and breakfast costs are included.
what if we fly business class, how $$$$
3857.61USD
Is this all you have in Essen?
Yes.
what's the rating on the hotel?
3.0 stars. 6.61/10 user rating.
If I increase my budget to a total of $6100, do you have something nicer in Essen?
No, that is the only option in Essen.
Well I guess we have no choice then LOL let's reserve it On business class
Ok, you’ve got it!
Where are you travelling?
Anywhere which gets us across the border. LOL.
I don’t understand. How many of you are travelling?
We are 3 adults and 3 kids.
I can get the six of you to Rosario, Argentina for $18194.
I need to find something for under $14800
I have a 2 star hotel in Rosario for 13646.60USD. The stay would last 18 days,
From when to when?
September 10-27.
Those dates seem to work and the price is more suitable. I'll take that one.
Sure! Do you want any more details before I proceed with the booking?
No, just need to get across the border.
Ok, I’ll just book it for you now then.
Thank you
My pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:
I can! Where are you leaving from?
That would be Santiago
What is your budget?
Nothing more than 1700 please
When do you need to be there?
As long as possible, between September 8 and September 25 (of this year)
There are no flights to Rome after the 8th.
That's strange. What about flights to Fortaleza then?
There are no results for this either within your budget.
This is alarming! How about lets try Sao Paulo
There are no results for your date range.
How about Retro Inn from Sept 1-13?
The dates fit but I would have preferred something until the 22nd
I can do Sept 11-22?
I have a $1500 budget, work within that My vacation is from the 1st to the 22 so anything in between
The original Retro Inn package would cost 1295.36USD.
Wifi is very important, is it included?
Yes, it is. So is breakfast and parking.
How is the hotel rated?
2.5 stars. 6.91/10 user review.
Can you find me something better for $1800?
I can book a 3 star hotel from Sept 11-22 for 1703.90USD. The user review is 8.98/10.
Well that sounds better. Is it close to anything?
Countryside is next to a market.
Okay I will google it. What amenities are included?
Free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking are all included.
I like this one much better. I will reserve it.
Great! Consider it done :slightly_smiling_face: Anything else I can do for you?

I have 1100 to spend on this
Are you just booking for 2?
Yup just the two of them
Are they flexible with their dates?
Decently flexible: anything between September 8 and 28

Rome?
Do you have a budget?
No budget for now
And travelling alone?
Yes
Would you rather travel from September 8th to 16th or September 11th to 15th? Both hotels are 4 stars and offer free breakfast and wifi.
I think the longer stay would be best! How much would that cost for economy flights?
2555.13 for economy flights.
Cool. I have a number of other cities on my list
Next up is Busan

Yes, just 2162.77USD for 10 days leaving on the 8th.
I don't need to stay 14 days
As I said, 10 days.
No 5 day packages?
No, sorry.
Actually. let's just see if we can find something in Sao Paulo out of Toronto.
I have nothing from Toronto to Sao Paulo.
Tofino To Sao Paulo?
I have nothing from Tofino to Sao Paulo.
Ugh! I really need to get home...I'll just book the flight leaving on the 3rd.

What was the name of the place again?
Berlin.
The hotel
Starlight Hotel is available
Yeah that's the one.

thanks bud
My pleasure!
Cool! Where are you guys from? And where would you like to go?
We live in beautiful Kingston, and we were thinking of visiting Guadalajara
When do you want to travel? And how much are you planning on spending on this trip?
Well, I work on my own schedule as a writer so dates are entirely flexible. What is far less flexible is my budget
I only have 1900
Unfortunately that won't be enough to take the family to Guadalajara. Do you have somewhere else in mind?
I was also thinking about Mexico City. Even a short trip would do, like two days
Mexico City won't work either. Anywhere else you would like to go?
That is…it :disappointed:
Yes! Where would you like to go?
Boston please. Sometime between September 1 and 16
What is your budget?
unlimited budget, but hoping for something in the four star range
How many people are travelling?
Me, and potentially a friend. But just search for 1 adult right now
We only have a 2.5 star hotel. Is this okay?
Thats fine, but I would probably tell you to look up another place right after :wink: You know what, lets just skip to that
check dallas for me
We have a 2.5 star hotel here as well.
Goiania?
Again, this is yielding only 2.5 star results as well.
Wow just not my lucky day. How about...Mexico City
Success! We have 3 and 3.5 star hotels. Which would you prefer?
cool! what amenities at each?
The first 3 star hotel, "Sublime Echo" is near a beach, shopping, and mall, and offers free parking and wifi. The second 3 star hotel, "Hotel Tropic" is near the beach and shopping, and offers free breakfast and wifi. The 3.5 star hotel "Exalted Willow Resort & Suites" is near the beach shopping, and mall, and offers free parking and wifi.
how much does the 3.5 cost
For business flights it would cost 1048.47 and for economy it would be 887.53. This package is for 10 days.
I think that would be the best choice! business isn't too exorbitantly priced so that's what I'll have
and book for two please
Okay great! For this option it will cost 2096.95 for two adults and business flights. Still okay?
still okay
Great! Your flights are booked! You will receive an email soon to confirm your purchase! Have a great day!
thank you!
Anytime!
Sure can! The best hotels we have in Chicago are 2.5 stars, and you can stay up to 9 days. When would you like to go there?
The time frame would be Sept 8 to 20
In this case, we have a 6 day vacation for you at a 2.5 star hotel near a museum and a university.
Thats doable. Can you also look up Fort Lauderdale?
In Fort Lauderdale we can only offer you a 2 star hotel near a market but you can stay 11 days.
Perfect. I didn’t even think we had much of a choice with our low budget, but I’m pleasantly surprised
I’m going to push my luck a little more
Can you check Belem?
Sorry I think you just ran out of luck. Nothing in Belem. Is there another destination you would like me to help you check?
I’d like to know more about Fort Lauderdale. Specifically, the dates and prices
The Fort Lauderdale hotel has been rated 8.22/10 by guests and offers free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. The package is from Sept 8-18, economy is available for 5512.8 and business is 6518.86.

asap
Is there anywhere else you can travel?

I can downgrade your flights to economy if you’d like to save some more money!
I'll be able to prepare for my meeting on business, worth the extra $. Thanks anyway.
No problem! Enjoy your stay at La Estrella del Mar :slightly_smiling_face:
Gracias!
Where would you like to go?
Rome where I can drink some nice red wine while the run amok
And where did you want to leave from?
Calgary
What kind of budget are we working with?
I can spend my entire winnings of $4300 who knows how long I'll be around
I have a 12 day package for one adult and six kids for 8820.42USD.
that would be fun except I would have to rob a bank to get the difference
Where else would you like to travel?
Leon also has nice red wine
Though I hear Leon, Spain is a hotspot for wine, unfortunately I have no packages available for you.
...okay how about Minneapolis, cause they must have some nice red wines there
I have a wonderful 8 day package available for you and your family to Minneapolis, USA for only 2619.68USD! How does that sound?
It sounds good but we MUST be near the park so I can relax and drink my wine while the children run amok
For a total cost of 3340.79USD I can book you an alternative package at Viridian Cottage Inn & Suites. This hotel is near a park, museum, and a mall! Plenty of places to enjoy the highly acclaimed wines of vineyards in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
I do hear Pennsylvania puts out some nice wines :mask: Is breakfast for the children included? And what is the rating on this hotel?
Breakfast is included! And the rating is 2.5 stars.
Did I mention they start school on Sept 29 so we must be back?
You would be back on September 19th!
They don't get out of camp until Sept 14 so we cannot fly out before then.
That’s ok - you would be flying out on September 16th.
So this is like a 4 day package?
That’s right!
Well it all sounds really good except for the crappy Minneapolis, Minnesota wines. Please go ahead and process this before I change my mind.
You’ve got it- email confirmation will be sent along shortly.
Thank you, my dear, sweet friend, you have been oh so helpful.
Happy to help :slightly_smiling_face:

Um business

You can take me to Tampa. Whats the nicest hotel you have there?
The nicest is a 3 star hotel close to the park, museum, beach, and airport. It offers free wifi, breakfast, and parking. Guests in the past have rated it 8.8/10. Does this sound appealing to you?
I just want to ascertain that it is somewhere a pop star might stay at. You can verify that you don't have anything better in town?
I confirm.
I’ll take your word for it! Ok lets talk numbers
I have 1300
And I’d like to get there on September 12
Where are you leaving from?
Portland

Thats it
Where are you leaving from?
Tofino will be our point of departure
Sorry, we do not offer flights from Tofino.

Sorry, nothing that works for your budget.

Sorry, I can’t offer that flight.
Can I go to Sao Paulo then?
Yes, I have two hotels for you. From Sept 7-12 or Sept 2-6.
Dates don't matter as long as we stick to my budget. Which hotel has a better rating?
3666.23USD for a 2.0 star 6 day package or 3228.11USD for the 3 star 7 day package.
Can you tell me a little more about the hotel with the 3 star rating?
It is near a cathedral and a theatre, has 5.14/10 from previous user reviews, and provides free parking, breakfast, and wifi to guests.
this one seems to fit the bill. Can you give me some flight information please?

Are you travelling alone?
I'm traveling with 6 adults including myself. We have 2200 between us
There are no results.
How about......if we left from Tofino?
Still nothing.
How about......if we went to Portland instead
...but this time...
...with 3 adults...
...and...
...wait for it...
...2500 in cold, hard, cash
Portland from Tofino or Tel Aviv?
Whichever works
There are no results.
Well I can't say I didn't try hard enough
Bye! Come again!
I'm afraid I cannot help you here.
Ok that was a stretch. Just trying to see if you would glitch and give me a freebie
But for real, where can I go with 400$?
Now that's better! I can take you to Punta Cana or Atlanta with that.
It would be nice to get out of the country! What hotel could you find me in Punta Cana?
You can have a 14 day trip to Punta Cana at a 2.5 star beachside hotel for 167.60 if you fly economy.
That is a bargain and a half. Does the hotel also serve free breakfast?
No, it is void of any amenities. But who needs those when you've got the beach?
WHY SEE THE WORLD, WHEN YOU’VE GOT THE BEACH?? you speak wise words
sign me up
Your trip is booked for you
That is all, my friend
No.
Oh. Ulsan to..Paris?
No.
Ok this isn't working out as intended. Do you fly from Ulsan to London?
No
Ok. Last chance
Ulsan to Dublin
We have a 2.5 star hotel for 2375.19 for economy and 3085.51 for business.
Of course :slightly_smiling_face: What is your point of departure and first potential destination?
Denver is where I live. Buenos Aires is one of the destinations on my wishlist.
I can book you in Buenos Aires from September 8th until the 19th for a total of 2754.1USD.
The 8th to 19th would work, although I am off work until the 28th. Can you tell me the name of the hotel & all the pertinent information so I can make a list?
Hotel Universe is a 3.5 star hotel, with an esteemed 8.69/10 from previous guests. Featured with your package are a daily breakfast buffet and access to wireless internet. This hotel is in the heart of the city located near lush green spaces to help you get the most of your getaway.
Hmmmm sounds like a good one but I want to see what else you have.  How many days total is this package?
13
Next destination: Punta Cana
I have September 2-12th for 1129.3USD, business class flights included.
Was Buenos Aires on business class too? I need to keep them all on the same type of flight so that I am comparing apples to apples.
This package in Punta Cana would cost 846.85USD.
Okay let's keep them all in economy for now. Can you tell me the name of the hotel & all the pertinent information please?
La Estrella del Mar is an unrated hotel, near a palace, and the stay would be 11 days in duration. I also have shorter duration trips of 5 days at El Mar, a 2.5 star beachside hotel.
Okay let's keep all the comparisons on packages 13 days in length, if possible. What services are provided with this hotel?
I have no information on additional services.
amenities?
Sorry, no info.
Let's look at Belem now with the same consistent parameters.
I have an 11 day package in Belem at Las Flores, a 3 star hotel near a cathedral for $1919.58. This hotel includes free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking and is well-loved by previous guests with a 8.49/10 user rating.
Fantastic! I have one more final destination on my wishlist - Columbus!
In Columbus I can offer you a 14 day stay at Crown Jungle Inn, a hotel located by the beach and a palace with 2.5 stars and a 8.49/10 user review. The hotel has free parking and complimentary wifi as well. The cost for this package would be 1661.5USD for economy class.
Buenos Aires is pretty expensive, Punta Cana too cheap, so I am between Belem and Columbus.
I also have a 9 day Belem package at a 4 star beachside hotel, Gentle Tower Resort.
How much is that one?
2933.19USD
I think I'll stick to the 11 day package in Belem at Las Flores, seems like the best deal and it had a good user rating. Let's book that one.
Ok! You’ve got it :slightly_smiling_face: I’ll send a confirmation email once I straighten everything up.

My best offer for leaving on Sep 6 is at a 2.5 star hotel for 6 days until Sep 10. Would you like to know more about this hotel?

No problem, for departure on the 8th, I have a 6 day package at a 3 star hotel, rated 8.86/10, with free wifi, breakfast, and parking.
How much for this one on economy? Can you check Kobe too please? I'll have to pick one, hope it's the right one!
The economy package at the San Diego hotel is 9364.56. For Kobe, I have a 5 day package leaving Sep 8 with a 3 star hotel for 19923.91 economy.
Anything cheaper in Kobe?
No, that is actually the cheapest option.
I guess that decides it, San Diego it is cause we only have 12600 to spend! Hope the rumours are right!
Sure! I'll book the San Diego trip for your group! Anything else I can do for you today?
11 days at a 2.5 star hotel near a park, 5.23/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 6th to 16th, business is 1790.30, economy is 1490.86.

When my hip hop career takes off, I'll buy them business class
It's the only option for this package anyway so you're in luck. I'll book it now and you'll get a confirmation email right away!
I can, and have, but unfortunately have nothing to offer.
What about to Essen??
I can offer 13 days in Essen for 1050 dollars from September fourth until the sixteenth.
Oh good! What's the deal with this one?
There's just the one hotel. But if you chose to fly economy class the price would be reduced to 882.93 USD. The hotel is the Relaxation Hotel and is near a palace with a 3 star rating - 6.61/10 from previous guests - and you will be provided with wireless internet access and breakfast at no further expense.
Its already so much cheaper than what I had expected to pay that I’m ok with business class Lets confirm this order :slightly_smiling_face:

Great! Consider it done.
We don't do flights to or from Jerusalem.

Not in Cairo. Are you still open to any city in the US?
I know I should be more open-minded, but this time around we really wanted to go to Cairo
we don't have anything better in Cairo. I could put you all on business flights though, and you can stay in Cairo for 10 days and still be okay budget-wise!

Yes, we have a lovely 4 star hotel near shopping hot spots, 8.49/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, September 6th to 23rd and the prices are 3726.61 for business flights and 2893.69 for economy flights.
If only I could get the vacation days off.. I could be there today :sleepy: I have one other place that tops my bucket list
Vancouver
What've you got there?
Here we have a 4 star hotel near a park, museum, and cathedral. This is a 12 day stay from September 11th to 22nd. The hotel has a 8.8/10 guest rating and offers free parking, breakfast, and wifi. This would cost 1091.30 for business flights and 926.52 for economy.
Wow - so cheap. What a steal!. Thanks for looking at my options for me, but for now I'll just be stuck here at work
No problem! Come back when you are able to book a flight and I'll get you the best package there is! Have a great day!
How many will you be?
We'll be 4 adults and 6 children.
Is there a strict budget you must follow?
I'm willing to pay a total of 15100
With your budget I can get you spots in an economy package at a 4 star hotel with free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. If you are willing to increase your budget though, I can see if I can get any other options for you.
How much does it cost with the economy package? And how many days would it be?
For economy it would be 14111.28 for 8 days from Sept 8-14.
If I am willing to increase my budget by about $1500, what else can you find for me?
Nothing better unfortunately.
Okay, I want to take the package you already mentioned, but what if I increase my budget by $1500?
There is nothing more I can offer you with an increase of $1500 of your budget. Would you be able to increase it more?
No, I think the 8 day package at a 4 star hotel should be good enough!
Wonderful! Would you like me to book it for your group of 10?
Yes please!
It's taken care of for you! Time to pack your bags :slightly_smiling_face:
Thank you very much!
The pleasure is all mine.
Traveling alone?
yes
Sorry, there are no results showing for Paris and your return date. Are you able to change one of these?
I can try! Do you have a budget?
Yea!! I'm travelling with 2 other trainers - we can spend up to 8600 dollars
Do you have dates of travel in mind?
We wanna leave on or after the 18th of this month
We have a great 4 star hotel near the airport and a cathedral. This is a 10 day package from September 26th to October 5th. the hotel has a 8.8/10 guest rating and they offer free breakfast and wifi. The package will cost 6255.67 for business flights and 4942.53 for economy flights.
I wanna leave a bit sooner. Can we go sooner if we went to Cancun?
I can get you to Toronto from the 18th to 25th at a 3 star hotel.
Ok, well tell me more about that place
It is near a cathedral, 9.16/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, economy flights, and the price is 7661.41.
Before I go ahead with that can you still tell me whatcha got in Cancun?? I hear that Mewtwo might have been spotted there more recently than Toronto..
We have one package at the Winter Vale Hotel available from September 21st to October 2nd. This is a 4 star hotel, 9.16/10 guest rating, free wifi, breakfast, and parking. The total for this package is 7910.35. There is also another availability at the same hotel but from September 20th to 28th for 6704.30.
Ok, thanks.. I think the Toronto package is better though. Cathedrals and old stuff like that are usually great pokestops
The hotel in Cancun is near a cathedral and university, if that makes a difference to you.
What!? How could you not have told me that before! Cancun it is!
Apologies. Which dates would you prefer, September 21st to October 2nd or September 20th to 28th?
Oh ah the 21st to 2nd of Oct please. Thats the cost you gave me before right?
I gave you both prices. The price for September 21st to October 2nd is 7910.35 and for September 20th to 28th is 6704.30.
oh ok sorry. Yes, that is fine as they are both in my budget
21st trip please
Great! It is booked! Have a great trip and good luck on your Pokémon hunt!
Thank you !
Will this be for 2 adults?
Yes, rgiht
I can take care of booking your honeymoon for you. How much would you like to allocate to your trip?
We are on a tight budget. The wedding was costly..
We have 1100 dollars left over
You are in luck, we have a package in Hiroshima within your budget at the Iceberg Resort  for 9 days with a departure of Sept 13 and a return date of Sept 21
Oh god, I am blessed! Can you tel lme what the hotel is like? Is it highly rated?
Well, it's a 3 star hotel with a 7.15/10 guest rating and included wifi and breakfast. It is also located close to the museum.
That is not bad at all. How much for the two of us?
901.60USD via economy class flights
Hey, sweet! 200 bucks leftover! Ok pal, its no 5 star palace, but its affordable! Book that for two please
Reservations have been taken care of, enjoy your honeymoon!
Thanks !
That sounds wonderful! Where are you coming from?
I'll be coming from Seoul and I'm thinking about going to Curitiba
Will it just be yourself?
No, it will be me and my best friend.
Perfect. We have quite a few range of offerings. Do you have a budget or do you just want to hear the best available packages we have?
No budget, just give me the best you've got!
Alrighty, our best vacation package is at a 3.5 star beachside hotel. In the past, guests have rated it 8.22/10. While there, you can enjoy access to free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. We offer a 8 day stay there with business flights available. If you are interested, we also have a few 3 star hotels available.
You don't have any hotels with 4 stars? And only 8 days? I prefer something longer!
The 3.5 star hotel is the best available in Curitiba. And we do offer trips up to 14 days. However, they will be at 3 star hotels. Are you interested?
Huh I don't know.
I am giving you the best options in Curitiba. Would you like to try another destination?
Yeah let's try Sydney. I want the best and I've got like two and a half weeks of free time.
Sydney is looking better! I've got a 4.0 star hotel with 8.86/10 guest rating. I can take you there for 6 days on business flights.
6 days only? I was hoping for something longer.
This is the only trip available in Sydney.
I think Curitiba must be better then.
I agree. Would you like to further explore some of the options in Curitiba?
I think I'll take the beachside hotel deal for 8 days if that's the best there is.
Sure! It will be 12555.78 for the business package. Would you like me to book it for you?
I'll take the package
Glad to help! This is booked for you! Hope you have a pleasant trip!
Thank you.
We have no flight out of Kabul
Well I will leave from Tel Aviv then
No Flights out of Tel Aviv either
Okay, where would you want to go?
I really wanna go to Minneapolis
Would you have a budget?
Yeah.. I have 3100 in my savings account.
Unfortunately there are no results for this within your budget. Do you have a second destination you were wondering about?
Would I able to get to Kobe maybe?
Again, not within your budget.
Hiroshima???
Nothing available within your budget, sadly.
Which city would you like us to check first?
punta cana
when would you like to go?
I’m free from the 13th until the 21st of september
For those dates, we only have the La Estrella del Mar available, a still unrated hotel for  2825.61USD
Unrated huh? sketchy.. i dunno. check Alexandria please
I have a 9 day stay available in Alexandria during your dates at the Bronze Inn & Suites, a 3 star hotel. It is located near the university and has a price of 1607.40USD.
What kind of user rating does it have
8.86 / 10!
that’s quite nice. do you have anything to rival that in Denver?
We have the Brass Renaissance Resort, another 3 star rated hotel with a 8.86/10 guest rating located near the park at 1525.51USD
nice.. but which of them has the most amenities?
They both have the same amenities with free wifi and free breakfast offered at both but Bronze also provides you with free parking, should you require it.
oh ok. i wont be renting a car so i dont care about that
how long is the package in denver
10 days
ok. I want denver please
Would you like an upgrade to business class?
how much? is that within my budget?
Your budget is $2900 and business class is $1931.76USD, so you are well below it.
oh wow - let’s do that then
Business class it is. That trip has been booked for you. Safe travels.
awesome
Sounds fun! Where will you be leaving from?
I'll be in Calgary for the rest of this week and I'm wondering if I can get there for 4000 dollars
When is the earliest you can leave?
I'm free to go whenever
We have a 5 star option from September 20th to 24th and another 5 star option from September 18th to 22nd.
Can you tell me about them?
The 20th to 24th is at The Sapphire Time. The hotel is near a park, market, and theatre. They have a 8.98/10 guest rating and offer free parking and wifi. The price of this package is 3524.83. The 18th to 22nd is at the Escape Cave. The hotel is near a park, mall, and shopping.  They have a 8.8/10 guest rating and offer free parking and wifi also. The price of this package is 3505.18, so a little bit cheaper.
Very detailed - I appreciated that.However, as much as I do love the BBQ, I also have to look at Recife, as I also thoroughly enjoy the variety of food available there
For that one though could you look for flights out of New York?
I think I'd be stopping back there before heading out
For Recife we have a 4 star hotel near a park, 8.22/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 13th to 24th, business flights are 3603.71, and economy flights are 2800.81.  This is The Glee.
That isn't bad.. but out of the two I'm gonna pick Sapphire Time. book that one for me, would ya?
Sure! This package will automatically be booked once you confirm payment in the confirmation email just sent to you. Have a nice day and enjoy the trip!
Great, thanks a bunch :smile:
I'm very sorry to inform you that we do not offer flights out of Tel Aviv. Can you leave from any other cities?
is there any flexibility on your date?
sure
Regretfully we do not have flight packages from Long Beach to Belo Horizonte
Sorry but we do not do flights out of Jerusalem at this time. Is there somewhere else you are able to flight out from?
Do you have a budget?
yeah. 67 hundred dollars
How many people altogether?
two
We have two results at the same hotel. We have a 14 day stay from September 13th to 25th, business and economy options are available. Business flights are 6412.89, economy flights are 4982.32. We also have an 8 day stay from September 25th to October 1st, this is only available for economy flights and the cost is 5878.84. The hotel is 2 stars, is near a park and museum, has a 6.61/10 guest rating, and offers free parking, breakfast, and wifi.

the package on the 13th to Philadelphia sounds better. its longer and I get to go hunting as soon as I can
book economy class, got it?
Got it! You can confirm your trip by opening the confirmation email sent to you. Have a great day and enjoy the trip!
Hi! I'd be happy to help with that. Where are you coming from and where would you like to go?
I haven't really decided a destination yet. We're leaving from Buenos Aires and we're looking for a nice family vacation.
I see! How many will you be? And when would you be available to travel?
Oh it's going to be a huge family vacation, so we'll be 5 adults and 7 children! We're looking for something between Monday September 12 and Monday September 19.
That sounds very nice! Do you want me to stay under a certain budget?
Yes please! That would be great. I don't want to spend any more than $29, 400 total
That's reasonable. Alrighty, since there are a lot of options, I will throw a few cities at you. Let me know if any of these catches your eye: Pittsburgh, Santos, Denver, San Diego, La Paz, Boston, and Sao Paulo.
Oh wow they all sound so good. Which ones are the most affordable?
The options I have previously presented are the longest and best trips that make the most of your budget. However, shorter trips would be more affordable. Would you like me to find the most affordable trips for you instead?
Oh I'll see what the longest and best trips are! Please tell me about them. Let's start with San Diego!
Maybe Santos, La Paz, or Sao Paulo might interest you. Of course I can run searches for shorter trips and perhaps get a few more available cities if you would like.
Let's try La Paz!
Nice choice! In La Paz we can offer you an 8 day stay at a fantastic 4.0 star hotel with free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi.
Ooh sounds nice! How much would that cost in the end?
It would be 22481.6 for economy seats and 28631.92 for business.
Wow that sounds really good! What are the departure and return dates of this trip?
This trip runs from Sept 13-19.
That's perfect. Could you please book that for me for economy?
Sure thing! It is all booked for you. Stay in tune for an email confirmation with all the details.
Thank you so much!
It's my absolute pleasure! Anything else I can do for you today?
Nope, it's all good. Have a nice day!
Rome to Curitiba, let me see... nothing.
ok ..... well I'd settle on Essen
Rome to Essen, nothing available either.
you are a disgrace. what about in St. Petersburg?
I apologize for the inconvenience. I also do not have anything from Rome to St. Petersburg.
Where will you need to leave from?
I can leave from Berlin
Is anyone else going to be travelling with you?
No, I alone
The best package I can offer is at The Double Pastures, a 4 star hotel near a cathedral, 8.98/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 11th to 23rd, business flights for 911.50, and economy flights for 810.76.
Ideal. Book business flights please
Great! It is booked! Have a great day!
You’re great
Is Kingston your destination?
Yea
I can help you with that. I have several choices in Kingston. How many people will be travelling to Kingston from Stuttgart?
I'm travelling alone ; helps me focus on my sensitive pallet
My hotels in Kingston go up to 4 stars and the length of stays between 4 days and ten days.
Higher stars are my preference, heart of the city or near a market helps too. Usually close to good restaurants
I have the Ebony Manor Inn & Suites, a 4 star hotel which is close to the museum available for 10 days or I have the Cosmos Inn which is a 2.5 star hotel located in the heart of the city available for 7 days.
Cosmos Inn sounds like a better location
It also includes free breakfast, parking and wifi and has a user rating of 6.37/10
However I would love to hear about San Juan 's accommodation offerings.
I have the Fairyland with a 4 star rating and a great location near the  museum, shopping and the food market at 2667.37USD for a 6 day stay.
Heyy that sounds awesome! What's the price difference between that one and Kingston's package in the heart of the city?
The Cosmos Inn in Kingston is  1225.8USD for a 7 day stay, so about half the price.
Hmm but yea, San Juan is still a little more appealing...Can we book that one?
Yes of course!
:ok_hand::knife_fork_plate:
Do you have a budget?
yes 2600
When would you like to leave for your endeavour?
September sixth. But dates are flexible
Sorry, my results tell me that there are no availabilities to Toluca.
what about for 2900
The budget is fine, it's just the destination that is unavailable. Is there another place you could go?
oh. No
Alright, do you have a budget?
3100 dollars
When would you like to leave?
September 6th
There are no results from Kabul to your destination, is there a different city you can depart from?
Where will you be coming from?
Birmingham
When would you like to go?
Ideally sometime between Tuesday September 13 and Wednesday September 28.
Okay last question, will you be going alone or with others?
Nah just me.
Great, we have two fantastic 5 star hotels in Berlin waiting for you! We offer 14 day or 15 packages. Would these interest you?
Yes please! Are they fairly affordable?
They are! For the 15 day package, we have the business package available for 1608.47 and the economy package for 1264.47. The 14 day package is slightly more expensive.
The 14 day package is more expensive than the 15 day package one?
Yes. The 14 day trip is 2752.48 for business and 2167.74 for economy.
Oh wow that's odd. What are the departure and return dates for the 15 day package then?
The 15 day trip is from Sept 14-28.
Wow that sounds great. What else can you tell me?
Sure! The hotel has an average guest rating of 8.49/10 and is conveniently located near a museum and a cathedral. During your stay, you can get breakfast and wifi free of charge.
Wow, that's amazing! You said this was a 5 star hotel right?
Yup
That's perfect. I'll take it!
Awesome! I will process the booking for you. Once confirmed, you will receive a confirmation via email.
That's excellent, thank you very much!
You're very welcome!
Hi! Sure! from where?
I can leave from wherever !
Great! Do you have a budget?
omg NooOoOo
Okay, when would you like to leave?
Whenever!
Do you need to return by a certain date?
Nope!! I can just do my thang whenever however long
Well my database tells me that there are no flights to Monterrey.
WHAAAAT omg. You  must have something in Columbus available for me
Our best package is a 3.5 star hotel, business class flights, hotel is near a museum, shopping, mall, and is also in the heart of the city, 8.22/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 12th to 25th, and the cost is 4942.67.

Where would you like to go?
Me and the gang are looking to get out of Barcelona from September 6th until the 15th. We’ve got a few destinations in mind - hows about Mexico City?
How many people will be traveling?
2 adults and 6 kids
We have a great package at a 3.5 star hotel near the beach, museum, shopping, and mall. The hotel has a 6.37/10 guest rating and offers free parking and wifi. This package is from September 8th to 13th. The business flights included put the price to 16699.53 and is all inclusive. If you are looking for a cheaper option, the cheapest package available is 11941.79.
Ok, that is within our 15 thousand dollar budget. But my kids really love La Paz.. so let’s check that place out
We have one result at a 4 star hotel, 8.98/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast and wifi, from September 8th to 13th, economy flights, for a grand total of 14931.80.
wow - nice! Any parks or beaches nearby for the young wippersnappers?
Not that I'm aware of.
ok. I wanna check out Milan then
We have one result from September 8th to 13th at a 4 star hotel near a museum, cathedral, and in the heart of the city. The hotel has a 8.37/10 guest rating and offers free breakfast and wifi. The business flight option is 5321.90 and the economy flight option is 4473.34.
hmm, its not really long...I wanna get the family out of the house for as long as we can
Unfortunately the packages I have provided are the longest packages available. There is one other package I didn't mention but it is the same length of time from the 7th to 12th.
ahh, ok. well if they’re all the same length.. I think I would be best off going with what the kids are interested in
Mexico City package will be the best for us
The Mexico City package is 16699.53 which is over your 15000 budget. Are you able to increase your budget or would you like to book the cheaper Mexico City package of 11941.79?
what is the difference between the two Mexico City packages? not in price, in hotel
The more expensive hotel is a 3.5 star hotel near the beach, museum, shopping, and mall. The hotel has a 6.37/10 guest rating and offers free parking and wifi. This is from September 8th to 13th. I overlooked another option that you can afford which is the economy flights version of this package that costs 12919.26. The other hotel which is the cheapest Mexico City package is a 3 star hotel near the beach, shopping, and mall. The hotel has a 6.91/10 guest rating and offers free parking and wifi. This package is only available for economy flights and is from September 7th to 12th.
even cheaper for a higher guest rating?! we’ll take it
Great! Glad I was able to help! Have a nice day and enjoy the vacation!
Do you have a departure and a desired destination you would like me to search for you?
we can leave after the tenth, whenever.. and want to maybe go to Manaus from Fort Lauderdale
How many adults in TOTAL
wow, no need to yell. 5 of us
An you want to leave after September 10th, correct? For how long?
right, for however long I need to to make this big sale
And what is your budget for this trip from Fort Lauderdale to Manaus for 5?
oh it makes no difference
In Manaus my highest rated hotel is 3.5 stars, is that okay?
no, it isnt. check Mexico City
At the moment, everything I have in Mexico City is also 3.5 star rated hotels or less
Dude.. you're killing me. check out Naples for me. I need a LUXURY experience
How about a 4 star with a 8.86/10 guest rating?
I guess that'd have to do. what are the amenities?
The Tower Hotel located in Naples includes free breakfast and free wifi and is available in a business class flight for a 10 day stay at 21803.47USD
that sounds fine. book business class please, you know how many travels?
5

It has all been taken care of. Pleasant travels.
you're a lifesaver
I can help with that! Where will you be coming from?
I'll be coming from Hiroshima.
How many people will be traveling?
Just me! I'm thinking of going there for a while.
I'm thinking about 6 weeks or so. I'm kinda flexible.
We have a 6 day trip from September 20-24 at a 3 star hotel. Will this work for you?
6 weeks, not 6 days. Sorry! Can you do that?
Unfortunately the 6 day trip is the only offer we have for Stuttgart. Is there somewhere else you would like to go?
Oh I see. In that case, do you have any trips to Kingston anytime soon?
Yes we do! When would you like to go?
Sometime this week or next week. I'm flexible.
The longest trip we have is a 10 day trip from September 8-16. Or would you be interested in shorter trips?
Yeah, shorter trips would be great.
In that case, I'd like to recommend our best hotel in Kingston. A 4.0 star hotel close to the museum. We offer 7 day trips here.
That sounds great. Could you give me more details?
Of course. It has a a guest rating of 8.22/10 and offers free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. The trip will run from September 12-17.
That sounds really good. Can you add anything to the package?
I will not be able to do that; however, you can visit the museum that is very closeby.
Okay cool, thanks. How much does it come to?
It will be 4041.98 if you choose to fly economy. Or you can update to business flights for a total of 5241.40.
I'll take business please.
Sounds good! You are headed to Kingston! Booking confirmation will come via email. Anything else for today?
Nope, I'm all good, thanks!
Glad to help :slightly_smiling_face:
You want a vacation for 2 people?

Well, there are many places we can send you to from Toluca. Do you have any preference whatsoever? Departure date? Budget?
i have 4 thousand, eighth hundred dollars... and i can travel between sept 6-19
I have a very good package for you at 2925.98USD. This deal is a 15 day stay at the 5 STAR Hotel Serene Palms Resort in Leon, Spain, on the beach, close to the palace.
oh wow that sounds amazing!! is there a spa?? can i get free breakfast??
No spa or free breakfast at this one
well where else can i go

ok what's the next best?
The Elton in Houston, 2.5 stars, located near the mall, includes parking, wifi and breakfast
not impressive... so.. Rome or Leon
well Leon is a nicer hotel - how long is the Rome trip tho?
14 days
minor difference. I prefer Leon in that case

It has been booked!

5300 dollars

Every hotel is near a park.

Okay. Would you prefer 11 days from September 15th to 24th or 9 days from September 26th to October 3rd?

I don't want to spend any more than $54700
That will be enough. Is there a date you have to return by?
Yes! Wednesday September 28
Okay. I have quite a few options for you. Do you want to hear the longest trips first or the highest star-rated ones first?
Longest I guess! Ones that will make the most of my budget!
That would surely be an 18 stay at our prestigious 4.0 star hotel next to the park, beach, shopping, and mall. It has a whoping guest rating of 10/10 and I can get you all into business class for 54474.39.
Oh that sounds good! But what is the city of destination?
None but the amazing Porto Alegre!
Oh wow that's really good. Is that the best option you have?
Yes, it is one of the longest trips we have and the best rated.
Do you have anything else comparable?
We also have 13 day trips to a 3.5 star hotel in both Atlanta. Would this be of interest to you?
Wow, that also sounds very nice. How much would that one cost?
It would be 30657.65 for economy class and 39694.35 for business class.
How much does the Porto Alegre package cost for economy?
That would be 41753.92.
You know what, I'll take the Porto Alegre package, and for business class!
That's a great choice! I have secured the booking for you! Your flight leaves on the 8th so better start packing :slightly_smiling_face:
Perfect, thank you!
With pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:
Where from?
Detroit. After Monday, the 12th
Do you have a budget?
no - not budget
Travelling alone?
The package must be impressive - keep that in mind. I’m bringing 5 high class clients so 6 adults in total/
You're in luck! We have an awesome 15 day package from September 13th to 27th at a 5 star hotel in Berlin. The hotel is near a museum, they have a 8.8/10 guest rating, and they offer free breakfast and wifi. For business flights with this package the cost is 16969.96.
That sounds suitable for some business fat cats. Have you got anything that rivals that package, but in Cordoba?
This package has a guest rating of 8.98/10, the trip is 13 days instead of 16 from September 17th to 29th, and the cost with business flights included is 20354.83.
Ok, what are the sights like near that hotel? And the amenities?
They are the same as the hotel in Berlin.
Ah, ok. Is there anything available in downtown Vancouver? Perhaps near some hot shopping districts, bars, etc..
There is a 4 star hotel near a park, museum, and cathedral.
Ah, that’s not impressive. Well I think I’d prefer Cordoba to Berlin..
Let’s book that - business class
Lovely! It is done! Good luck on your trip!

No we don't
Is that your departure?

I don't want to spend any more than 2000, and we'll be coming from Belo Horizonte.
Sorry, we don't have anything that works with the size of your party and budget. Would you be flexible with you budget by any chance?
I'm only willing to increase by $200, would it be possible to find something with that?
Unfortunately it is still a no. Anything else I can help you search?
Not even a nearby city for a couple of days?
Sadly no. Not with a budget of 2200.

I can help with that! When would you like to take this trip?
Either on or after Tuesday September 13 please.
Do you have a set budget in mind?
Yes! 3100 is the most I would like to spend so anything under that would be great.
Sure, I'd recommend a 4 day stay at a 3.0 star hotel near a park. 6.51It has 3.4/10 guest ratings and offers free wifi.
How much would that cost?
It would be 2037.8.
Okay! Just curious, do you have anything closer to 3100 for a longer stay, or a better hotel?
I can get you on business flights with the same package for 2536.77. Or I can offer you a 5 day stay at a 2.5 star hotel in the heart of the city for 2546.97.
Does this 2.5 star hotel have a decent guest rating?
It seems reasonably rated at 6.77/10.
Is the 3 star hotel also in the heart of the city by any chance?
That is correct! It also offers free parking and free wifi!
You know what actually? I think I'll take the 4 day stay in the end.
That's not a problem! Would you prefer business or economy class flights?
Oh economy!
Great! I have processed the reservation and you will be billed a total of 2037.8.
Great, thanks!
My pleasure!

From where?
Can you get me, my wife, and 5 kids there from Marseille for 16500?
Can you depart on September 7th?
No. Not until the 20th
Is a 19 day holiday too long?
As long as we're back by the 7th of October, its all good! Tell me about the package
That one would have you back on October 8th
Rats - no good! Check out Salvador instead
I found you a 17 day holiday in Sao Paulo from the 21st of September to the 6th Azure Spire Hotel, 2 star near the cathedral and the theatre for 6480.13USD including your breakfast
2 stars... you really think I can bring that to the old lady without repercussions? anything better in Detroit?
Nothing in Detroit
fine. book the longer one in Sao Paulo
I will proceed with booking!
Okay, where would you like to go?
I heard Brasilia has some nice casinos
How many people will be travelling from Brasilia to Phoenix?
No! You misunderstood me! from Phoenix TO Brasilia. 
I apologize. From Phoenix to Brasilia. Number of people?
just me, gotta keep under the radar for a bit till the loan sharks get off my back
Do you have a budget for this trip?
3100
The Sublime Tower in Brasilia has 7 and 10 day packages available. When would you like to leave?
September 14th
I have no Sept 14 departures available to Brasilia. For the Sublime Tower I have Sept 8 and Sept 10th departures and I have 7 day packages available at the Atlantic Gem  with a Sept 26 departure.
What if I leave from Campinas instead?
From Campinas, the earliest departure after the 14th is also on Sept 26th
Is there anything to Curitiba?
From Phoenix or Campinas?
Phoenix
I have a departure from Phoenix to Curitiba exactly on the 14th of September for a 14 day package at the 3 star Dual Basin Residence located on the beach near the shopping, market and mall. This package included free parking, wifi and breakfast.
Sign me up! How much?
Would you prefer to fly via economy or business class?
business if i can afford it. How much would it be for business?
A business class flight is still well below  your budget of 3100USD at  2011.70USD
Wow! Yeah, put me down for 1
Perfect, I will proceed with the booking at the Dual Basin Residence from September 14th to September 27th via business class for 1 week. Thank you for your booking and safe travel.
Thanks, you basically saved my life.
Where are you coming from? And when would you like to go?
Dublin
How many will you be?
just me for now
Okay, I have for you an 11 day stay from Sept 12-21 at a 2.5 star hotel close to the park, university, and mall.
Anything with a higher rated hotel?
Unfortunately no, that is our only availability in Dublin that meets your criteria.
Hmmm, could you check Rome then?
I regret to inform you that there are no trips to Rome that works for you.
my dates are flexible, would that change anything?
That certainly does! We can offer you a 12 day stay from Sept 11-21 at a 4.0 star hotel near the cathedral with a whooping 8.98/10 guest rating.
well thats definitely sounding pretty good. I'm just curious to see if I can find a 5 star hotel. What if I leave from Melbourne instead and fly to Dublin?
I could not find a 5.0 star hotel for you with those selections, sorry! The best is in fact a 2.5 star hotel.
Anything from Melbourne to Rome for 5 stars?
Sadly no, the best in Rome is still the one that I previously mentioned.
hmm okay well how about if I go to Sendai?
Our best in Sendai is also a 4.0 star hotel. It has guest ratings of 8.8/10 and is near a park and museum.
How long is the trip to Sendai?
You will be there for 9 days from Sept 7-14.
what is the price for business class flights?
It would be 2843.16.
how about going from Kochi to Rome?
12 days with business flights would be 3258.45.
well that's not a huge difference and the Rome trip is longer......better guest rating too....yeah. I want this one, can you book it for me? ... actulally
can you book it for me and 2 others?
Absolutely! The same package for the 3 of you will be a total of 9775.37. Should I confirm this reservation for you?
Definitely!
It is confirmed for you! Hope you have a great trip!
Thanks!
Absolutely! I can help you with that. Where would you like to leave from?
Beijing
I’m sorry but we do not currently operate out of Beijing. Is this another destination you could depart from?
No, there isn't.
I’m sorry, it seems I won’t be able to help you then.
Where are you located?
I'll be leaving from sf but I haven't really decided on where to go exactly yet.
Yes, of course! What are your desired dates of travel?
Sometime between Sunday September 11 and Tuesday September 27 would be great!
Can you tell me how much money you’re willing to spend?
I don't really have a budget in mind. But the package that would make the most of my money and give me the greatest offer is what I'm looking for.
Sure! What destination should I look at first?
How about Pittsburgh?
In Pittsburgh I have a 15 day package available for as low as 1500 dollars. You would be staying at a 2.5 star hotel with a 6.91/10 guest rating. The hotel includes free parking, wifi, and complimentary breakfast, and is situated near a park. The date of departure would be the 12th of September and the return date would be September 26th.
That doesn't sound bad.
Would you like to hear about shorter packages available in Pittsburgh?
Nah the time frame sounds good. I'm curious about another city though!
How about Stuttgart?
I have one package available in Stuttgart which departs from San Francisco September 20th and returns the 27th. You would spend 9 days at a 3 star hotel near a museum for just over 2500 dollars with economy flights. The hotel’s guest rating is 7.15/10 and it features wireless internet access, breakfast, and parking at no extra charge.
I'm curious about Punta Cana.
I have two different hotels in Punta Cana - one with 10 day packages and the other with 5 day packages. Would you like to hear about both?
Nah I think I prefer a longer trip so just tell me about the 10 day package please.
Sure! That would be the Scarlet Peaks Hotel - a 3 star hotel near a cathedral. For a price of 1992.41 USD, your 10 day stay would include free wifi and breakfast every day. You would leave on September 11th and return home on the 20th. Previous guests have rated this hotel 6.77/10.
This also sounds really good!
Yes! Would you like to book anything yet?
I'd love to check out Rome, it's somewhere I've always wanted to go!
In Rome I have two different hotels with 9 day packages, one hotel with a 10 day packages, or another hotel with 15 day packages. Which would you prefer to hear about first?
Let's try the 15 day one!
If you chose to spend 15 days in Rome, you could stay at The Double Pastures. This hotel is 4 stars, near a cathedral, and boasts a 8.98/10 guest review rating. The package departs September 11th and returns the 24th. Included with this vacation are wifi access and breakfast. If you chose to fly economy, the price would be $3787.88.
Wow that sounds really nice! What if I decide to stay in Rome for 10 days?
In that case you would stay at the Hotel Emerald Legacy, a hotel with very similar features to The Double Pastures but a differing guest rating with 8.22/10. The price for this 10 day package would be 3534.46USD and you would depart September 11th to return on the 19th.
And for 9 days?
There is the unrated Secret
the unrated Secret?
There is the unrated Secret Bay, a hotel with free breakfast and wifi. There is also the 4 star Hotel Grand Residence with the same amenities as the others. This hotel has a 8.8/10 guest rating.
How much would those cost?
The Grand Residence would be 2703 for 9 days while the Secret would be 2337.15
You know what? I think I've decided! Could you please book the 15 day package to Rome for me?
I absolutely can! Are economy class flights ok?
Yes, that would be perfect!
Ok! You will receive a confirmation email shortly. Enjoy your stay!
Great, thanks!
My pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:
Could you provide the dates for me please?
whenever
Where would you like to go and from where?
I don’t know where i want to go, i was hoping you could help me decide. I would be leaving from Rome. I only have $400 tho
I have no packages available out of Rome for $400. best I can do is 4 days in Milan at $710.13
cant afford it. What if I left from Porto?
If you left from Porto instead of Rome,  I can offer you a 4 day package at the Hotel Fernando Ribero for 193.43USD
Can you tell me more about the hotel?
It is a 2.5 star hotel located near the park, shopping and a mall and it includes free parking, unlimited wifi use and a nice breakfast. It is available from September 18 to September 21.

what a rip off. why do i even bother with technology, the old ways of doing things are much more concrete.
I can help you find something. When would you like to go?
somewhere between september 8th and 20th.
The hotel that works best for you would be a 3.0 star hotel near the park, museum, and palace. It boasts a guest rating of 8.49/10 and offers free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi.
When is this?
The longest package leaves from Punta Cana from September 8 to 20.
Thats perfect! How much is this?
It is 3034.61, and I can offer an upgrade to business class for a total of 3813.58.
Not bad. Do you have anything to San Juan?
We do, but our only hotel near a park is a 2.5 star hotel with 0/10 guest ratings. Would you want more information on this hotel?
No thats fine haha. Is there anything to Goiania?

I have an 8 day package at the Glacier for 2190.28. It leaves September 8th.
Do you have anything that leaves soon but also for longer?

That's okay. What more can you tell me about the 8 day package at Glacier?
This hotel is 4.5 star with 9.16/10 in guest ratings. The hotel is near the airport and has free parking as well as free wifi for guests. The flight departs for Hamburg on September 8th and returns to Tokyo on September 14th.
That sounds really good!

Yes sure!
Ok, I will just get your information and secure the package confirmation for you.

well i have 1600 in the bank so does it fall under that?

But yeah we can try somewhere else.
Where?
How about Nagoya?
I can do that. I have the 3 star Oceanside Resort available for 9 days from September 12th to 20th. You would be staying near a university and have access to free parking, complimentary breakfast, and unlimited wifi usage. The total for your family of 3 would be 1554.40 USD.

Sorry, this is the only package I have for Nagoya.

Great! I can upgrade you to business class flights at a total cost of 1723.51USD if you would like.

That is the only availability in Kochi.

Perfect! Can you book me this trip then?
Of course! Consider it done :slightly_smiling_face: Anything else for today?
nope! thanks!

Unfortunately, it does not appear that we have flights from Seoul to Hiroshima.
What about from Seoul to San Diego?
It does not appear that we have flights from Seoul to San Diego either.
What about from Cordoba to San Diego?
I have possibilities of 2 different hotels in San Diego for you. Do you have certain travel dates and a length of stay in mind?
nope just whenever
I can suggest the Spare Time for an eleven day stay for you. It has a 3 star rating with a 8.86/10 guest rating, and offers all the amenities such as wifi, parking and breakfast as part of your package.
nice! I’ll take it
Your total comes out to 2009.43USD and you fly out Sept 14 and return on September 23. Thank you for your business and have a very nice trip.
Thnx
Sure! When would you like to travel?
I managed to get some time off work between Thursday September 8 and Friday September 23 so anytime within those dates would be perfect! I'm looking for something for 7 days.
Ok! Do you want to go anywhere in particular? Or within any budget?
My budget's flexible, but I am stuck between two destinations.
Sure! What’s the first one? I can check both.
I'm thinking about Mexico City.
I have 9 days for you at the Sublime Echo, a 3 star beachside hotel that is handy to shopping districts and malls. The hotel would also provide parking for any rental car you may purchase free of charge. Wifi access is also included in your package price of 3401.2USD.
Is that all you've got? For Mexico City?
Nope! For 9 days you could also stay at the Hotel Tropic, or spend 8 days at the all inclusive Coast; both of these hotels also offer 5 day packages if you’re interested.
Tell me about the 8 day package please.
At the Coast you would have free parking and free wifi. The package is all inclusive as well, as it is a 3.5 star hotel with a 6.37/10 rating from guests. You will be staying close to many attractions, such as museums, beaches, shopping, and malls.
How much does it cost?
4457.63USD if you fly economy class.
Ah I see. Can you could check out another destination for me please? I was thinking about going to Manaus as well.
I have an 8 day package in Manaus for 5445.49USD. You would be staying at the 2.5 star Hotel Mundo near a park and shopping district and have access to free parking, wifi, and breakfast for the duration of your stay.
Oh that doesn't sound too bad either. For the 8 day trip to Mexico City, what are the departure and return dates?
I also have longer packages in Manaus if you are interested in hearing about them.
No, I prefer something closer to 7 days.
The Manaus trip spans from September 12th-18th.
And Mexico City? The 8 day one?
The Mexico City trip would be from September 10th-16th
Okay then, I think I've decided. I'll take the 8 day package to Mexico City please.
Ok! Consider it booked :slightly_smiling_face:
Great, thanks!
My pleasure. Anything else that I can assist you with today?

When would you like to leave?
september 16th
My earliest departure is on Sept 20th, does that work for you? How many people will be travelling to Rome together?
What about if i leave from Hamburg?
From Hamburg, I have departures on the 11th and on the 20th
What about from Tijuana to Manaus?
From Tijuana to Manaus my earliest flights are on Sept 14th and Sept 21st
From Hamburg to Manaus?
From Hamburg to Manaus I have flights on the 14th and the 20th.
No i really needed to leave on the 16th. that’s okay, i’ll figure something out.
I'm sorry, we currently do not serve flights out of Tel Aviv but hope to do so in the future. Would you be able to leave from somewhere else for now?
:eye: guess :eye: could leave from Tofino
Sadly we don't have any available trips out of Tofino either. Would you have another alternative?
no. ugh. i guess i'll look somewhere else.
I can’t offer anything out of Tofino unfortunately. Is there an alternate departure city I could try for you?
But all 9 of us will be coming from there!
Can I look into something else for you?
No thank you.
I have no packages available for Burlington to Washington
What about to Toluca?
Nothing for Burlington to Toluca either
Balderdash! What about Melbourne?
Nothing for Burlington to Melbourne
WHAT!?!?! Ugh, kill me now. Okkay fine. I'll look somewhere else.
Happy to help! Which dates are your vacation and where are you coming from?
I can leave on or after Monday and i would need to leave from Rosario
Is there a budget you'd like me to work with?
nope!
Okay, we offer 6 day trips starting on Monday to Maceio, St. Louis, and New York. If none of these destinations interest you, we have a few other destinations with 5 day trips.
I’d like to look at just the 6 day trips and if i dont find anything i like we can look at the 5 day trips. Whats the best you have in Maceio?
It would be a 3.5 star hotel close to the park and shopping with 8.37/10 guest ratings.
not too shabby, anything to St. Louis?
In SL we have a 3.0 star beachside hotel with 7.15/10 guest ratings.
That’s the best in SL?
It's the best that works with your vacation dates.
Okay, um let’s hear what ya got for New York.
We've got a 2.5 star hotel near the museum and airport. It has a guest rating of 8.22/10.
no way. Do you have any 5 star hotels anywhere?
No
Well can i hear them anyway, I might be willing to work something out if i find a package that’s worth it.
We actually don't have 5 star hotels available for any trips 6 days or under leaving from Rosario. Would you be able to make your dates flexible or leave from another city?
No. You know what, it’s fine, I’ll just look somewhere else or take my vacations days another time if i cant find a trip. Thanks anyway.
Where would you like to go?
I don't have a destination in mind. I was hoping you could help me with that.
How much money are you willing to spend?
I'm flexible about that. But I'm looking for a 6 day vacation package.
When would you like to leave?
Either on or after Sunday September 18 please.
Are you travelling by yourself?
Yep!
I have a 6 day package to Silver Palace in Queenstown for 766.63USD. This is at a 5 star hotel near the airport and a museum with free breakfast, free wifi, and a guest rating of 8.86/10.
Wow, that sounds really good!
Would you like to book ?
I was wondering... is there anything else you can offer? As great as that sounds, I'd like to explore my options.
There is also a 6 day package at a 3 star hotel in Stuttgart for 724.50USD.
So far, the Queenstown one sounds best. Have you got anything else though?
You could spend 6 days at a 5 star hotel with free wifi in Munich for 293.87USD.
Wow that's really cheap. You know what, I think I'll take the Queenstown one please.
What are the dates for that
September 28-October 3
Oh! I have to ask... Is the Munich package closer to September 18?
You would leave September 20 and return the 26th with the Munich package.
Sorry for being so indecisive. I'll take the Munich package in the end!
Sure! I can upgrade your package to business class flights for a total of only 392.22 USD. Do you want to do that?
Sure why not!
Ok, I will go ahead and book that in that case.
Great, thank you.
I am happy to help :slightly_smiling_face:

Do you have a budget for this trip?
Nope! The sky is the limit!

That's not too bad. I'd really like to pull out the big guns tho, this is a big deal, do you have any 5 star options available?
4.5 is the highest that I have available in Hiroshima. It also has an excellent 8.86/10 guest rating.
Do you have any 5 star hotels in Curitiba?
3.5 stars is our highest in Curitiba
ew. What about San Francisco?

Where would you like to go&gt;
I'd like to go to both Rio de Janeiro and Guadalajara. But from Mexico City.

I can book you from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro for 13 days starting September 10th for 2335.73USD.
I don't need to go there for that long. Can you give me a shorter package deal?
How about 7 days for 1607.99USD? You would leave on September 8th.
That sounds pretty good.
Ok! Would you like some more information?
Yes please.
La Perfección is a 3 star hotel near a park, museum, and university. It has a 8.22/10 user rating and free parking, breakfast, as well as free wifi.

That I can help with! How does an 11 day stay at a 4.5 star hotel near the airport sound?
Sounds good enough. Out of curiosity, is there a 5 star hotel?

I have several choices. How long were you hoping to stay in San Antonio?
from the 13th to the 1st
My shortest package in San Antonio is a 9 day package. I have a choice of 2 different hotels, both with a 2 star rating.
What are the dates for it?
Both are from Sept 12th to Sept 20th
well i think my 7 days of vacation only apply to work days so that should work since part of the trip is on the weekend. Can you fill me in on more hotel details?
You have a choice between the Vertex Inn, a 2 star hotel near the park, museum and the mall at 1277.9USD OR the Winter Hill Inn, also a 2 star hotel near the park, mall ans theatre. Both included wifi, parking and breakfast. However, the Vertex Inn has a guest rating of 7.15/10 whereas the Winter Hill Inn had a guest rating of 4.74/10.

Yeah for sure!
I can send you to San Antonio on a 15 day package from September 14 to September 28 or I can send you to Busan  on a 6 day package from September 14 to September 18th.
I think the 6 day package fits my dates the best. Can you tell me more about it?
First let's get your budget
I dont have a budget
Perfect. The Busan hotel is available for a 6 day stay at  3107.21USD. Included is your parking, use of wifi and your breakfast. The hotel is situated near the park, museum and not far from the university.
sounds pretty good to me, is this the business or economy price?
That price is based on economy class pricing. I also have that package available at 4047.3USD on business class.
I'll splurge and take the business class flights, nothing wrong with spoiling yourself once in a while
I will proceed with the business reservations
Thank you
When can you go?
whenever but my bday is coming up so the sooner the better
Alright, how many are you total?

I can put you all in a fantastic 4 star hotel near a museum and a park. Does that work for you?
Maybe but I’d really like to find a 5 star. Is there a one in Ulsan?
You are in luck! We've got a 5 star hotel in Ulsan close to the park, market, and theatre. I can put you guys there for 9 days.
oo la la! intriguing! before i book it can you check for a 5 star in Sacramento?
There actually is! This 5 star hotel is near the museum and boasts a guest rating of 10/10.
what is the guest rating for the other hotel in Ulsan?
It is 8.98/10.
Yeah we will defs be going to Sacramento!

You're very welcome! Have an amazing time :slightly_smiling_face:
Just you?

I can put you for 7 days in a 3 star hotel in the heart of Sao Paulo. How does that sound?

That is the best currently in Sao Paulo.
Anything in Queenstown?
Absolutely! In Queenstown our best is a 5 star hotel with 8.86/10 ratings. I can put you there for 6 days.

Unfortunately no.
Okay well then I’ll take the Queenstown trip. Can you tell me more about the hotel tho?
Yup! The hotel is close to the museum and airport. It also offers breakfast and wifi free of charge. Your stay will be from September 22 to 26.

Thank you kindly!
Sure thing! When would you like to go?
After September 6
Ok, travelling alone?
Yeah, it's for a job.
Sadly we do not offer flights to Kabul from St. Louis. Where else can I look for you?
But I've done it before.
This trip is not currently available.
It's been done before, so don't pretend that you don't have flights from Kabul to St. Louis. It's really important for me to get there.
There are no flights from St. Louis to Kabul. Can I look into another destination for you?
Yeah, I figured. I can't believe you guys got rid of it. Is this a question of money? If I offered you more money, then would a trip from St. Louis to Kabul suddenly present itself?
Sadly we do not offer flights to Kabul from St. Louis. Where else can I look for you?
So if I raised my budget by a few hundred dollars, then would you have a package to Kabul for me?
Sadly we do not offer flights to Kabul from St. Louis. Where else can I look for you?
Okay, so what if I offer an extra $1000. Then would you have a trip to Kabul from me?
Sadly we do not offer flights to Kabul from St. Louis. Where else can I look for you?
No where else damn it! I need to get to Kabul!
Sadly we do not offer flights to Kabul from St. Louis. Where else can I look for you?
Nowhere else!
Sadly we do not offer flights to Kabul from St. Louis. Where else can I look for you?
You can't look anywhere else because Kabul is the only place I need to be.
Sadly we do not offer flights to Kabul from St. Louis. Where else can I look for you?
I'll go somewhere that will take my money and get me to Kabul.
You will go somewhere else? I can help you with that. Where would you like to go?
I mean I'm going to another service.
Goodbye.
Bye. And thanks for nothing.
You are welcome :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi there
Can you help me find a vacation package from Indianapolis to Essen for under 3500 and between September 6th and 22nd please?
I have no packages available within those parameters
Well how about to Montreal?
Neither unfortunately.
Nagoya?
Neither. Are you able to depart from another city?
No, I'll just go to another travel agency. Thanks anyway
I have nothing available from Miami to Beijing
Well IF I make my dates flexible are there any results?
From Beijing to Miami, even if I make the dates flexible, I get no results, which means we just don't have any packages to that destination from that destination
Okay, well thanks anyway.
Sorry to inform you we currently do not offer flights between those two cities. Is there somewhere else you'd like to go?
this happened last time too ugh. I’m kind of getting sick of Selena always ranting about her Justin and Demi problems ugh. I’ll just go to Goiania anyway and hope for the best.
We do have some options for that. Our best one is a 3.5 star hotel close to the museum, shopping, and airport. We have availabilities for 14 days.
sure that works. Tell me more about the package
It has a guest rating of 8.69/10, free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi.
what are the dates
Sep 14-27.
kk. How long is the flight and can i get business?
Of course, I can get you into business class for 3261.73.
thanks. book it.
Consider it done! Anything else I can do for you today?
Nope. Thank you
Ok! Where would you like to go?
There are a few places but I do have a budget of 2300. I'm thinking Belo Horizonte.
Where would you like to leave from?
Anywhere really. Doesn't matter!
Ah, ok. When would you like to go?
Sometime between Thursday September 8 and Tuesday September 27, and preferably a trip that lasts at least 4 days or more.
I have several beach side hotels available in Belo Horizonte for you within your budget.
Leaving from where?
Goinania, Porto Alegre, Santo Domingo, or Maceio.
Do you have hotels near a park? I need a park to walk the dog.
They are all near beaches.
In that case, can I try another destination then?
Ok. Where?
Again, I'm looking for a hotel near a park in Berlin.
I have many hotels near museums in Berlin. Does that interest you?
No, I want a hotel near a park.
Sorry, I don’t see any in Berlin.
I hear Toronto is a good city.
Unfortunately I am only seeing trips for one hotel in Toronto and it is not near a park. I am limited in the amount of results I can fetch; if you could suggest a departure city it would be very helpful to narrow down the selection.
In that case, I'll try Belo Horizonte again. At least I can take the dog to the beach. What's the most highly rated hotel you have in Belo Horizonte?
The only hotel I can see in Belo Horizonte is 2.5 stars. Do you have a maximum length of stay?
No, as long as it fits my budget. And is within those dates I gave you earlier.
Ok. I can book 17 days for two adults at Tranquil Season Hotel for only 1332.83USD.
What are the departure and return dates for that, and where is it leaving from?
You would leave from Porto on September 9th and return on the 25th.
Can you tell me more about what this package includes please?
It is a 2.5 star hotel with free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking.
That sounds like a pretty good deal.
Ok! Consider it booked.
Great, thanks!
My pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:
Do you have a preference for when you would like to travel?
preferably between september 6th and 18th
I have a couple of places. Are you searching for hotels with higher ratings or do you prefer to choose a place by location?
I'm looking for high ratings but i'd like to hear about location as well, just in case

Okay well it’s better than nothing at all. You can book this for me
Sure. I can book the 9 day trip for you. You can actually afford business class flights for 265.27. Would you like me to book that?

Hmmmm the 7 day package is a lot more expensive than the 12 day  but it seems like a nicer place, plus I like the fact that we can take the kids to the museum.  Does it depart on September 12th too?
Yes. It departs Monday September 12th and returns on Saturday September 17th. Would you like me to book this trip?
Yes, I like this package better. Please book us on economy class at a cost of $20697.17  and send me all the details by email. Good job, friend!

dope. are the hotels in Calgary or Denver nicer tho?
There are no nicer hotels in Denver, but Calgary's different. It's a 4.0 star hotel next to a university and it offers the same amenities as the Atlanta hotel.
i'd rather be at a beach than a school...can I afford to fly business class to Atlanta
No.
fine book that one but economy class.. i'm just stoked to be staying on the beach for under 400
Sounds good. I will sign you up for it! Email confirmation is coming your way.
thanks bud
Sure can! You can go for up to 14 days to a 3.5 star hotel in the heart of Campinas, close to the mall and cathedral.
Get out! How much would that cost me... hypothetically
3355.13 with economy flights and just 4335.7 for an upgrade to business class.
:heart_eyes: Would I be able to afford a trip to Rio de Janeiro?
Yes you can. You can afford to stay up to 16 days at a 3.0 star hotel near the park, museum, and university.
Would I have amenities included? What would I pay for that one?
The hotel's got everything covered! With free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. The economy seats will cost you 4144.38.
Impressive!! Now, I may be being greedy here..
If I was to keep my sunshine spree domestic
And went to Atlanta..
I'm wondering if I could be under budget enough that I'd have enough left over for maybe another trip
That is actually very possible. For a 10 day stay in a 3.5 star beachside hotel, it will just be 1283.2 in business class and 962.67 in economy class.
Wow!! Sweet! Well I am still stuck at work, as you know
So I can't book anything
But I appreciate you entertaining me this evening
Where will you depart from?
MY WIFE WORKS HERE IN SPAIN
Okay! Do you have a budget?
GOT A TRANSFER OVERSEAS FOR AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT. ITS BEEN FUN HERE

YEAH WE HAVE 14700 !
WE ARE GOING TO BRING OUR CHILDREN TO SEE SAN JUAN AND MEET THE FAMILY
THERE ARE 5 ADULTS AND 1 YOUNGIN
When would you like to go to San Juan?
WELL JEEZ. I DONT EVEN KNOW WHEN THE REUNION IS !
HA~
WE CAN JUST GO WHENEVER I GUESS
AS LONG AS WE’RE IN THE CITY
IN THE NEAR FUTURE… SHOULD BE FINE
We have 3 results available. We have a 12 day and 9 day package at a 4 star hotel, and a 10 day package at a 2.5 star hotel.
OK DEFINITELY MORE INTERSTED IN THE 4 STAR!!! ARE THE 12 AND 9 DAY TRIPS BOTH AT THE SAME HOTEL?
They have the same name
WHAT IS THAT HOTEL LIKE?
Fairyland has a 8.98/10 guest rating, it is located near a museum, shopping, and a market, and they offer free wifi.
THAT SOUNDS IDEAL. GREAT LOCATION
WHAT IS THE PRICE FOR THE 12 DAY?
13776.57 and it is from September 14th to 24th.
Perfect! And a thousand under budget! SOUNDS LIKE OUR WINNER
Would you like me to book it for you?
YEAH DO THAT PLEASE
Great! All done! Have a great trip!
OK THANK U
Okay, where would you like to go?
Not me, I'm not going anywhere! I need THEM out of town! Send them anywhere you can!
So would that just be two adults then? And is there a budget?
Yes my mom and dad. I have $5700 in savings. It has to be something romantic coz I'm giving it to them as an "anniversary" gift.
I found an excellent 18 day package at a 3 star hotel by the beach in Atlanta, US, costing a grand total of 4889.80. Would you be interested in booking this trip?
3 star?!? They'll never go for it....they like luxury. Got anything that's like a 5 star?!
The closest thing I have is a 15 day package to Rosario with a 4 star hotel. They can fly with business class, costing at a total of 2624.13. Would you be interested in booking this?
How about something on the beach? My mom likes to suntan.
I'm afraid of all the options I have, there is no hotel by the beach that is above 3 stars. Would you be interested in booking a 3 star hotel by the beach?
The 4 star hotel in Rosario, what's that one like?
The hotel has a rating of 8.86 out of 10 and you can do some great shopping in the area. Breakfast and wifi is included with the package, and it departs on Friday September 23rd, returning to Salvador on Friday October 7th.
k the 23rd should be good...enough time to prepare for the competition. I don't want to spend all my savings though...they don't need to fly on business class that;s for rich people. Whats it cost on economy?
The package with economy class would cost a total of 2204.67 USD.  Would you like me to book this package to Rosario for you?
YES!!!! Lets get them outta town!
Perfect. The booking is complete.
Thanks! :airplane::joy:
You're welcome!
I can help you out with that! Where are you coming from?
i am in Barcelona. and I can travel from sept 6-21
What is one of the cities you can go to?

Okay, our best deal for you is an 11-day long trip with a stay at a 3.5 star hotel for 3895.67.

In Los Angeles we can also offer you an 11 day stay. This time it will be a 3.0 star hotel next to the airport and mall. All for 2475.71.

Not just free wifi, also free parking and free breakfast!
ah, great. what are the dates
It's from September 8-18.
before i book anything can you check San Diego
Sure. In San Diego our best is a 9-day trip at a 3.0 star hotel near the park for 1388.27.
which has a higher user rating - Los Angeles or San Diego?
They are the same: 8.86/10. They also offer the same amenities.
oh, wow.. both are good reviews... well Los Angeles is near a mall.. I think that's where the mall of america is
I want that one
Alrighty then! Would you like to go for a business upgrade for 3153.44 or the economy for 2475.71?

Do you have a budget?
1900
Travelling alone?

Any budget?
yes. I have 2100
Alone?
yes, just me
There are no results showing for Alexandria, are you able to leave from somewhere else?

check Belem
Nothing to Belem
um. what
Valencia then
Nothing for Valencia either.
Okay. Do you have a budget?
ah.. no. I haven’t had a budget since before I made it onto Billboard
Okay. When would you like to go?
as soon as possible. I should be back here by the 15th though
There are no flights available. Is there somewhere else you'd like to go?
Rome then
Still nothing.
you’re kidding me...I’ll push my 16th concert ahead

Nothing.
pathetic.. why am I even here. check from Lima to Manaus
Our best package is a 3 star hotel.
to Rome then…..
We have a 4 star hotel.
decent...guest rating? where is it located? what are the amenities?
8.22/10 guest rating, located near a cathedral, and offers free breakfast and wifi. It is from the 11th to 18th of September.
I don’t know what I was thinking for a moment... i am not going to settle for a 4 star
goodbye
When is your trip and how much do you have to spend?
Thank you, thank you. From September 17 until the second of October
I have 2700 left over from working this summer
and the internship is unpaid so I'd like to stay under that if possible..
I have good news for you! We have a 4 star hotel in the heart of Milan close to the cathedral and museum. With your budget you can stay there for 8 days.
ah - very nice. Um, so what are the amenities?
The hotel offers free wifi and breakfast during your stay.
not bad, not bad. Can you also look at Sacramento packages for me?
Of course! In Sacramento we can offer you a 10 day stay at a 3.0 star hotel close to the museum.
very nice! Breakfast and Wifi as well?
Yup! Plus free parking.
Very nice indeed. What do previous guests think of the place?
They seem to like it! On average, guests have rated it 6.91/10.
So I suppose I would like that as well..But can I check Santiago packages real quick before I do anything
I'm sorry to inform you that there's nothing that matches your selections in Santiago. Would you like to go with one of your first two choices?
that's fine.. at least the other two options are nicer. Could you tell me the guest rating for the Milan hotel?
It has gathered an amazing 8.37/10 average rating from previous guests.
I think I would prefer that one. Italy sounds far more exotic than California anyway
What is the price and dates of travel for that one?
It would be 1907.5 for 8 days from September 22 to 28.
you know, I think I wanna go ahead and book that one.
It is done for you! Simple as that :slightly_smiling_face:
Wow great, you've been super helpful!
Okay. Where would you like to go?
Alexandria. Pronto. Alexandria is where's it's at.
I'm afraid we do not offer any packages that leave from Beijing. Would you like to leave from another city?
Yeah try Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv to Alexandria
I'm afraid we do not offer any packages that leave from Tel Aviv either. Would you like to leave from another city?
CRAP!!!!! Try Beijing to Cancun then.
I'm afraid we do not offer any packages that leave from Beijing and Tel Aviv. Would you like to leave from another city?
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE TEL AVIV TO CANCUN THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!???
I'm afraid we do not offer any packages that leave from Tel Aviv. Would you like to leave from another city?
GOODBYE
Goodbye. Thank you for using our services.
May I book a trip for you?
Listen I'm on a budget soooooo I want you to find me the best deal ever understand? We want to go to Phoenix with the kids.
How many of you will there be? And where will you be leaving from?
There is my wife, me, her mother :grimacing: and our gaggle of 5 kids
3 adults and 5 children then?
Yes that's it  we need a good deal
What is your budget and where will you be leaving from?
We live in Atlanta and no more than $4800 for ALL of us got it?
I have an amazing 15 day package costing at a total of $4415.39 for all of you. You will be all set up at a 3 star hotel located near a museum and a university, and this will include free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. Would you like me to book this for you?
3 star? Got anything better?
I'm afraid not. That is the most upscale hotel we have of all the packages.
What 't the guest rating on the 15 day package?
It's the same hotel for the two packages that we have, and the guest rating is 6.91 out of 10. Would you be interested in booking the 15 day package?
NO. I would like to see what else you have. Do you have any other hotels or are you giving me just one choice?
I'm afraid we only have two packages available for what you're looking for, and they're both with the same hotel. Would you be interested in booking one of these packages?
Can you stop asking me that please! We take one vacation every 3 years and I need to look at all my options! If I increase my budget to $5800, what can you offer us?
I am afraid that increasing your budget will leave you with the same options, with the 3 star hotel. Is there another destination you would like me to search for you?
It's nice that you are meeting my budget but I really need to look at more than just one 3 star hotel in Phoenix. I will shop around and get back to you if I can't find something better. Have a nice day.
Thank you for stopping by. Good luck!
Where would you like to go?
i havent taken any vacation days in like 2 years, im off though from septmeber 12th to 25th
maybe essen

Do you have a budget for your vacation?
nope - i am treating myself
Are you going by yourself?
yes, getting away from it all. everything.
We have a 5 day and 6 day package at a 2 star hotel in Essen.
oh dear a 2 star hotel… for my one vacation in all this time. anything nicer in New York?
We have a 13 day and 9 day package at a 2.5 star hotel in New York.
hm. marginally better
what are the nearby attractions? any nice amenities… maybe a relaxing spa?
It is near a museum and the airport. They offer free parking, breakfast, and wifi.
sounds dull...what about in essen?
They offer free wifi and parking.
and anything nice nearby?
Nothing nearby according to my database.
i must say, i am pretty disappointed with this. can you check Ciudad Juarez as a saving grace?
We have an 8 day and 4 day package at a 3.5 star hotel. They offer free parking, breakfast and wifi, and they are near a palace, they also have a 8.8/10 guest rating.
oh god, finally something optimistic how much for the 8 day package?
789.12 for economy flights included and 971.12 for business flights included.

business flights
Awesome! Well, your flights are booked! You will receive email confirmation soon. Is there anything else I can help you with?
nope - you have taken great care of me. thanks!!!!
Hello! How may I be of help?
im just... exhausted. i need to get out of toluca
and i cant make up my mind where to go
i know a couple places but
i dunno
maybe you can tell me which is better
I'd love to help with that! When would you like to take this trip?
well i am off from the 15th to 26th of september
And how much budget do you have for this trip?
i don't really have one, i need to treat myself... within reason of course..
In that case, I'll let you know a few offerings we have and we can start from there. Given your selections, we've got a 13 day trip to Paris, and 11 day trips to Detroit, Atlanta, Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Essen. These are the longest trips we offer.
oh wow, thanks, but i was actually thinking about going to porto alegre
No problem. In Porto we can offer you a 5 day stay at a 3.5 star hotel next to shopping, a university, and a mall.
that's alright - i would rather be near like a park, beach, garden.. something like that, i've just been cooped up in an office for ages so outdoor attractions would be better
We have no particular hotels in Porto close to outdoor attractions. Would you like to try another destination?
ahh, ok, well i was also thinking about denver
We only have a 3.0 star hotel in Denver that matches your needs; however, it is not particularly close to any outdoor activities.
hm.. well how else does it suit my needs?
It works well with your dates since it's a 10 day trip from September 15 to 24, and it is in your destination of choice.
ah, ok. maybe you could go back to those places you mentioned before.. i would like to hear about Hiroshima'
Sure, in Hiroshima we can bring you to a 3.0 star hotel with 7.15/10 guest ratings near a museum.
what about Kyoto?
In Kyoto we also have a 3 star hotel near a museum. This one has 8.69/10 guest ratings.
nice! which is cheaper, hiroshima or kyoto?
Hiroshima would be an 11 day trip for 4164.55 while Kyoto would be an 8 day trip for 3435.68.
gotcha. well I like the kyoto place more
what is the hotel called?
It is none but the Sakura Inn.
ok. what is the Paris option you mentioned earlier?
Our Paris trip includes a 13 day stay at a prestigious 4.0 star hotel with 8.49/10 rating for 2888.25.
wow, that's better than the others so far... is it near anything cool?
I do not have any information on that unfortunately.
ah that's ok .. seems like the best deal. I'll take it'\
Sure, I will book it for you! You're headed to Paris from September 15-26!
much appreciated - thanks!
I can certainly help you with that! How many of you will there be and which city would you like to go to?
Just me. Santo Domingo.
Do you have a budget in mind for this vacation?
2900
And is there a certain number of days you would like to spend?
My vacation time is from September 24 to September 27.
The shortest package we have to Santo Domingo is 10 days long. Are your dates flexible at all?
No they are not. 
DO you have another destination in mind?
No I don't. Thanks for your help anyway, Good day.
Do you have a budget?
I don’t think so
Do you know when you'd like to go?
yeah between September 6th and 9th. but the dates are flexible
And will you be traveling alone?
no. 6 adults
There are no flights showing from Phoenix to Monterrey.
Okay! Where will you be leaving from?
Los Angeles
How long would you like to go for?
As long as my $3400 lasts but it has to be the absolute nicest place in Kabul
I'm afraid no results have been in our database. Would you like to go somewhere else?
No it has to be Kabul. I will go somewhere else, Thanks.
Hi! How can I help you with this?
I;m trying to get to Rome from Long Beach. Between the 20th of September and the 5th of October. No budget.

Okay. I am in Fukuoka and I really have to go to Osaka.
Will it be just you? And are you travelling on a budget?

I have a 4 day package to Osaka leaving on September 20. It's involves a 3 star hotel and it costs 523.92 for business class and 474.62 for economy. Would you be interested in this package at all?

I'm afraid we don't have any hotels on the beach, but there is a museum and a cathedral nearby! Would you like to book this trip?
ok pls check la paz from santa cruz
For La Paz we have only a 10 day trip at a 4 star hotel. Economy would cost 2726.75 and business would cost 3491.67. What do you think?

I found a beautiful 12 day trip for you in Frankfurt, Germany departing on Monday 12th September. It's a 4.5 star hotel costing a total of 2893.33 for economy class and 3717.75 for business class. Are you interested in booking this trip?
Sounds lovely! Just want to hear what else is available first.
There's also an 11 day trip in Maceio, Brazil at a 3.5 star hotel that's situated near a park and with some great shopping around the corner! This costs 2312.44 for economy class and 2954.98 for business. What do you think?
Ok. Not bad! Frankfurt sounds a bit better though. What else?
There is an 11 day package in Hiroshima, Japan, at a 3 star hotel with a museum nearby.  Economy flights cost 3442 while business class would be 4481.63. What do you think?
So the ratings just keep going down hey? What is the guest rating there.

Yeah, lets go with Frankfurt.

I just need to be there after the 21st. I can stay as long as my budget allows
Not a problem! Our most highly rated hotel is a 4.5 star for 6 days, and business class would cost you 3046.43, fitting you right with the budget! Does this interest you?

From?
And I need to stay in the heart of the city, near restaurants. Salvador.
I've got a 5 star hotel. It's not in the heart of the city exactly but it's close to the museum, cathedral, and palace, so I'd say it's pretty nicely located.
Ah, ok - yes, there are rarely notable Cathedrals in the suburbs. Should be sufficient... And are you able to book 8 adults and one child there for 2900 dollars?
Sorry no, you'd have to raise your budget.
In that case my lawyers will have to book on there own - one child and one adult.
Can't do that for under 2900 either...
How much would it be then?
3651.61 for one adult + one child.
Ok, that's fine. I will go ahead with booking

yeah that’s fine, can we book it now?
Of course. I will  proceed with the reservation.
Thanks
Sure thing! Where will you be coming from? And do you have a budget?
Well we just finished our wedding in Burlington so we can leave from here anytime. We blew out both of our bank accounts for the wedding so now the both of us can put together only 1800.
I'm afraid we don't offer anything that fits your budget. Is your budget flexibl?
Can you find me something in Tampa?
Most certainly. We have a 7 day package at the Dual Loch Hotel which has 3 stars and has a guest rating of 8.8/10. It includes free parking, breakfast, and wifi, costing at 1487.43 for economy and 1785.35 for business. Would you be interested in booking?
Nice! Is it close to something cool?
It is close to many things, including a park, a museum, a beach, and an airport. Would you like to book this trip?
Before I get too carried away, is this the only option that works for us?
The only other package we have is a 4 day one with the same hotel, costing at 1755.8 for economy class. Which package would you prefer?
So it's actually cheaper to stay longer??
That's what I've found in my database, yes.
Okay.. We were thinking of only stay 4 days to save money and go back to work earlier... but in this case... We'll go for the 7 days!
Would you like to book economy or business class?
I'm going to splurge for biz since I can afford it :slightly_smiling_face:
Good choice! Your package has now been booked. Enjoy your holiday!
Thank you!

I have a great package for you to Porto Alegre! It's a 7 day trip at a 3.5 star hotel with a guest rating of 9.16/10. It includes free breakfast and wifi, and it would cost 2196.98 for economy class and 2810.6 for business. Are you interested?

Have you got anything better in Tampa?

No, the Atlantis Peaks Resort in Frankfurt does not have a spa on the premises
ok then i’ll go with marseille
There are business class seats available with this package. Do you want me to book you on those? The total cost will be 18412.34USD for the 5 day package.

Okay that’s fine. We’ll take it.
I have made the reservation, have a pleasant trip.
thanks!
So that would be 2 adults and 7 children? Where are you coming from and where would you like to go?
Yup! Our family's settled in Vancouver. I've got a few sweet destinations in mind but can you help me check Punta Cana first?
Not a problem. Do you have a fixed budget?
Yeah that's the hard part... we're hoping to spend only 1300
I'm afraid we have nothing that accommodates your budget. Could you expand your budget?
Ugh that's what I thought. The most I can convince her to spend is $1000 more
I'm afraid we still don't have anything that accommodates your budget. Would you like to try another destination?
This is harder than I thought... What about Denver?
I have an 8 day package to Denver costing at 1900.60 for business and 1420.71 for economy. Would this interest you?
Sounds pretty good.. can you tell me more about the hotel?
It's 3 stars with wifi included and there is a museum and university nearby.
How much did other guests like it?
There's no guest rating for this one, I'm afraid. Are you still interested in this package?
Are there any other hotels or packages in Denver?
I'm afraid that's all we have for Denver...
Okay.. anything for Santiago then?
Nothing that suits your accommodation I'm afraid. How else may I help you?
That's all for now! I'm going to talk to my wife about the Denver option and come back to you once we've decided.
My pleasure. Have a good day.

When is this trip?
From Saturday September 17th to Sunday September 25th. Does this interest you?
That could work.. is this the longest trip you have?
Yes indeed. Shall I proceed with booking?
Not so fast.. what amenities does this hotel provide?
Free parking, breakfast, and wifi! Sounds amazing, doesn't it?
Does sound pretty good.. I'm curious about Sao Paulo though. Can you help me check?
We have a 9 day trip that offers free breakfast and wifi, costing 556.73 for economy and 658.91 for business. Does this pique your interest?
That's a good deal! What kind of hotel is ut?
It's a 3 star hotel, which is the most highly rated that we have, with a guest rating of 6.91/10. There are also plenty of activities for you nearby as the hotel is situated in the heart of the city within walking distance of a cathedral and a theatre. Doesn't this sound amazing? Ready to book?
This does sound pretty good... before I book though, can you just help me look into Hiroshima?
Of course! I can offer you a 14 day package for 4853.37 for economy class at a hotel that includes free breakfast and wifi. Not a bad deal, right?
How's the rating and star level of the hotel? Is it as good as the Sao Paulo one?
Yes it is! It's also 3 stars but the guest rating is 7.15/10. What do you think?
And I assume that's also the highest rated you've got? Are there also nice activities nearby?

Hm that's a tough choice... What are the dates for this? And also for the Sao Paulo one?
The dates for this are Monday September 12 to Friday September 23. For the Sao Paulo one, it's Tuesday September 13th to Wednesday September 21st. Which do you prefer?
The dates for the Sao Paulo package works better for me actually! And I also think I shouldn't splurge on this trip since I'm not being paid... I'll take the Sao Paulo trip then! Business class though... :slightly_smiling_face:
Consider it booked! You will be receiving an email within the next 24 hours. Have a good trip!
Great! Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:

but I want to learn more about other trips. what kind of package can I get if I decide to go to Cancun
In Cancun I have a 10 day package at a 4 star hotel, a 9 day trip to a 3.5 star hotel, or 7 day trips to the same 4 star hotel or a 3 star hotel. All within your budget.
Wow the Cancun 10 day package sounds amazing. I want to take that package so badly.
Ok! I will book it for you.
No no I'm not ready to book it! I want to check out Toronto first please
In Toronto there is a 10 day trip at a 3 star hotel, two 7 day packages to different 3 star hotels, or 5 day trips to either 3 or 4 star hotels.
That sounds good, but not as good. I'm just going to think about it and get back to you.  I don't really have any days off at the moment. Thanks for all your help. Bye!
Goodbye

Okay. Sorry! Good luck!
Hi there! Many destinations are calling for you :slightly_smiling_face:
We'd like to go to Brasilia please. 4 kids, 1 adult
Sure! Where from?
We're from Punta Cana. I'd like to bring them while they're still out of school, sometime between Wednesday September 14 and Tuesday October 4th would be great.
Sorry, we currently do not offer any trips from Punta Cana to Brasilia. Is there another place you'd like to take them?
Oh I guess Alexandria would be good.. We've only got 4900 dollars though, keep in mind.
Sure! With that I can place you and your grandchildren in a 3 star hotel near the university for 6 days. This hotel has a fantastic guest rating of 8.86/10 and offers free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi during your stay.
That sounds good, but do you have any longer packages? I want the kids to have as much fun as possible!
If you had another destination in mind, I can help you check for the trips available there!
Well, we could also consider Sao Paulo...
For Sao Paulo I've got a 9 day trip! However, it is at a 2.0 star hotel. Are you interested in hearing more about this option?
No, I think the 3 star hotel in Alexandria sounds pretty good, thank you. Could you please book it for us?
Yup! Consider it done :slightly_smiling_face: Hope you have a good trip!
Thank you!
You're most welcome!
I will check what our availabilities are. First, Do you have a budget?
This is a business trip. I have a budget of 6900
When would you like to leave and/or return?
12 to 30
Travelling alone?
yes like I said "I am one adult" I am definitely getting my secretary to do this next time now find me something cause time = $
Are you looking for a certain rating for hotels or location of hotel?
who are you, the Grand Inquisitor?!? GET ME THE BEST FOR MY MONEY THIS IS A BUSINESS EXPENSE
Certainly! How does a 14 day stay at The Brass Tower Inn sound? It has a 7.06/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, and is situated near a market.
How much does it cost? I can only spend a total of 7600.
That would cost 7810.25USD.
Is there a better package that suits my budget? Thanks.
I have one package available within your budget. It would be an 11 day stay at Supreme Seaside Inn & Suites, a 2.5 star hotel near a park and mall. It has free breakfast and free wifi. The cost would be $6810.
It doesn't sound bad. But if I add another 1500 to my budget, do you think you can find something better for me?
Yes - I can find you the package I mentioned earlier for 7810.25 USD.
I guess if it's the best you can do...then I'll take it.
I also have a 13 day stay at Fairyland for 8438.46USD. This is a 4 star hotel near shopping, a museum, and a market with a 8.98 guest rating. Free wifi is included.
Wow that's amazing. I think we'll take that one.

That sounds pretty good to me but since I am new at this and travelling alone for the first time I need to look at ALL my internship options. What about flights and hotels to Detroit?
We have an 8 day stay from the 16th to 23rd at a 3 star hotel near a park and mall. The hotel has a 8.86/10 guest rating and offers free parking, breakfast, and wifi. The cost of this package is 2265.38 and it is only available in economy.
What about in Santo Domingo?
We have no results for Santo Domingo
It really would be better if I was near the university. Do you have anything in Detroit near the university?
I don't have anything else to offer in Detroit
That decides it then, I'll take the one in Chicago!!! How do I book it?
Would you like to book Business or economy flights?
Definitely economy
Ok! Consider it done! You will receive the email shortly. Have a great day and enjoy the trip!
Thank you!!! :hugging_face:

When do you need to get there? And where are you from?
Anytime soon would be good. I'll be flying from Buenos Aires.
How does an 11 day stay at a 4 star hotel sound? This trip runs from Sept 14 - 24
That sounds really good, but how much does it cost?
With economy flights it would be 2774.28, and with business flights it would be 3583.43.
That's even better than I expected. Sounds like a fantastic deal. I will take it, and at business class please.
Done! Your trip is booked for you! Watch out for the confirmation email coming your way!
Thank you very much.
Not a problem! Have a good trip!
Ok! Where are you looking to go?
We're thinking of going to Rome, we hear it's the hottest place to be.
And where are you leaving from?
Santa Cruz. We've only got 13000 though, that should be enough for an awesome trip!

The 4 star sounds great, tell me more!
It has a 8.8/10 guest rating, free breakfast and free wifi, and is close to shopping and a cathedral.
That sounds so good, how much is that?
7460.60USD to fly business class or 5744.51USD for economy.
That's definitely within our budget! I'm curious about one other city though. Could you just check Phili for us please?
In Philadelphia I have the Mirror Inn available for either 9 or 15 days. It is a 2 star hotel near a park and a museum, has free parking, breakfast, and wifi, and has 6.61/10 as a user rating.
Oh the Rome deal sounds much better.

Wow that's excellent. Do you mind if I just ask about another city? I'm also thinking about going to Indianapolis...
No problem! Unfortunately we don't have anything for Indianapolis that matches your parameters. Are you dates or budget flexible?
Oh that's fine, I'll just stick to Hamburg since it's already such a great deal anyway! I'll book the economy package please.
Okay it is booked for you! 2740.40 will be charged to your account. Anything else I can do for you today?

We have two results. A 6 day package to Tampa from the 11th to 16th, and a 5 day package to Atlanta from the 12th to 16th.
I can only leave on the 12th. So tell me more about the second option please
It is a 3 star hotel near the beach, 7.15/10 guest rating, free parking and wifi, economy flights, and the cost is 2801.25.
No breakfast included?
No, unfortunately.
I guess that sound okay, I'll take it
Great! Booked! Have a nice day!
Sure! Can you let me know how many will you be? It'll also be helpful to know if you have fixed dates or budgets in mind.
We'll be 3 adults and 4 kids, and we're looking for something between Saturday September 10 and Wednesday September 28. A package that isn't over 25500 would be good.
Alright that's plenty to start with! I can take you guys to Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Boston, Seattle, or Frankfurt. These are our longer trips at most 19 days long. If you are interested in shorter trips, I can search for that too.
Long trips with highly rated hotels? How about that?
Well of the options above, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires have 3 star hotels, Frankfurt has a 4.5 star hotel, and Seattle has a 5 star hotel.
Ooh let's try Frankfurt then. Tell me more.
In Frankfurt it will be a 17 day stay from the 12th to the 27th, during which you will enjoy free breakfast and free wifi. Guests in the past have praised the hotel with an average 8.86/10 rating.
No museum or shopping mall nearby for the kids to check out?
It does not specific any points of interest nearby the hotel in my database. However, the kids do get to enjoy free wifi.
Oh that's alright then, hopefully we'll find something! How much would that cost?
We offer the regular economy package for 17460.9 and the business upgrade for 22510.83.
Okay great, we'll take the economy package for that please.
Sure thing! I will book it for you. Hope you have a great vacation :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks!
Let’s start with one place - where you’d like to leave from!
Oh I'm from Santo Domingo.
Ok! Do you have any destinations in mind or would you like me to suggest a few?
Yeah I have a few in mind. I hear Queenstown is great, very historical. Let's start with that.
And do you have a budget?
Nah, not really. It's flexible.
Any dates in mind?
Oh yes! Friday September 16 to Wednesday September 28.
Ok ! I have Queenstown Emerald Mountain Hotel from Sept 18th-28th. This is a 4 star hotel near a museum with a 8.22/10 guest rating. The facility also hosts free parking, free breakfast, and provides unlimited wifi use at no extra charge.
Wow that's very good. I'm definitely keeping that one in mind. I have to say though, I'm also curious about St. Louis.
Sorry, I have nothing within your date range.
Oh that's fine. How about Columbus?
I have 5 or 7 day trips to Crown Jungle Inn available. It is a 2.5 star hotel near the beach and a palace. It has a 8.49/10 guest rating and provides free parking and free wifi.
Ah Queenstown still sounds much better.
Shall I book Queenstown for you?
Hmmm can I just ask about one more destination please? I'm also thinking about Busan.
I have one hotel in Busan - the Smile Hotel. You would stay 9 days at this 3 star hotel near a park and museum with free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi all included.
How much would that be and how much would the Queenstown one be?
This Busan package would cost 4840.13USD with economy class flights.
And the Queenstown one?
The Queenstown package price is 2443.66USD if you fly economy class.
Whoa, huge difference! I think we have a clear winner then. Queenstown it is!
Ok! I’ll go ahead and book that then.
Great, thanks!
My pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:

Yes it is, it would be 9503.73.
What about the 20 day package in Rome?
18762.47 for business flights.
I'll book the San Juan package in business class flights, 20 days is much too long with my clients
Great! It is booked! Have a great trip and good luck!

There are still no results.
Can you try Tofino then? For 12 of us?
Budget?
2000
Nothing.
Ridiculous
Absolutely! Where do you want to go and when do you want to go there?
No, dates or places in mind. Was hoping you could help me. Something as cheap as possible.
Do you have a budget?
Just something crazy cheap.
I have 9 days at the Cosmos Inn in Kingston for $2764.
That's not crazy cheap
I can't accomodate your request
what's the cheapest you got?
The cheapest package I can see at this point is to Mexico City for 1061.36USD.
How about a budget of $400?
I have one trip under 400 - 7 days at the Crown Jungle Inn in Columbus for 399.8USD.
Yes let's go with that!

Our best package is 12 days in SL at a 3 star hotel from the 14th to 30th. The hotel is close to the airport and beach, they have a 6.91/10 guest rating and offer free breakfast and wifi. The cost for business is 9043.35 and for economy is 7573.39.
Not big on SL...got anything else?
New York, San Antonio, Dublin, Indianapolis, and Fort Lauderdale.
What can you give us in Indianapolis?
2.5 stars, beach, shopping, 6.37/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, wifi, 13th to 29th, 7983.43 for economy, and 9596.90 for business.
Not great...Fort Lauderdale?
2 star hotel near market, 8.22/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast and wifi, 14th to 29th, 10656.19, economy.
Nice guest rating but 2 star is just way too low, plus it's more expensive. SL makes more sense. Is it $7573.39 for all 14 of us?
yes.
Can you give me the departure time please so i can let everyone know?
3 pm for departure.
Those times are reasonable with kids. I guess I will reserve that one. What do you need from me?
You will receive a confirmation email soon where you can give us information and payment. Have a great trip!
Fantastic. Thanks a bunch!
No problem!
Sure! Where are you looking to go? And can you tell me where you’d be departing from?
We're leaving from Tofino and we're thinking of going to Santos.
Sorry, no can do. I don’t offer any trips to or from Tofino.
Oh really? Don't you know who I am?
I cannot book trips out of Tofino.
Fine, if you're going to be like that... I guess we can leave from Frankfurt.
I have a variety of 3 and 3.5 star hotel in Santos for you. When would you like to travel?
Is 3.5 stars the best you can do? Are you serious? How about if we go to St. Louis then
In St. Louis I also have 3 and 3.5 star hotels.
What's the most highly guest-rated hotel you have?
Palacio Tranquila in St. Louis has 9.16/10 from users.
What more can you tell me about this package
The hotel is near an airport and a theatre, it provides free parking and wifi, and complimentary breakfast is included.
How much is it? And does it come before September 12th? Because that's when I need to get back in order to perform.
3662.78USD with economy class flights. You would depart Frankfurt on Sept 16th and return on the 25th.
okay, I'm talking business class here. Do I look like an economy class type of person to you? What do you take me for?
A business class package would cost 4709.76USD.
Cut the attitude and stop treating me like a second-class citizen. I'll take this package but that's the last time I'm ever going to use your services
I will send along booking confirmation. Thank you for using!
Sure! How many are you and what's your budget?
5 adults and 7 kids! Yup, the lot of us. We want to spend no more than 32800.
Do you have any date constraints?
Oh yes! Between September 12 and 26!
In that case, I would like to recommend you our best deal: a 15 day stay at a prestigious 4 star hotel in Queenstown with free breakfast, wifi, and parking during your entire stay. For the whole family it will just be 31122.0.
That sounds amazing, and it's within those dates? Is that economy class?
Yup it's from the 12th to the 25th, and it will be economy class.
Ok perfect, book me!
Consider it done! Have a good trip :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks!
My pleasure!
