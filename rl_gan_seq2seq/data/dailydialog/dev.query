good afternoon . this is michelle li speaking , calling on behalf of iba . is mr meng available at all ?
this is mr meng speaking , michelle .
oh , hello ! sorry about that . i 'm just calling to say that we 've received your new corporate credit card from hq .
that was quick ! i was n't expecting it until later this week .
yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
shall i come in and collect it ?
or we can send it to you . but if you would like to use it at the atm , you 'll need to wait for your pin number .
mmmm ... if i come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way i could use it today ? petty cash is getting low , so i need to draw some money .
as long as you bring your id , etc , we can serve you over the counter . but you wo n't be able to use the atm until your new pin number arrives .
what qualifications should a reporter have ?
as a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . at the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others .

hi , good morning , miss ? what can i help you with ?
good morning i 'd like to mail this box of books to taiwan .
ok , please put it on this scale.airmail or by sea ?
how long does it take to reach taiwan by sea ?
usually about two month .
that 's too long.how long does it take to reach taiwan by airmail ?
about ten days .
then how much is that by airmail ?
let me see.it ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
that 's a little bit expensive .
although it 's expensive to send it by airmail , it 's quicker and safer than by sea .
i guess i have to send it by airmail .
do you want to ensure the contents , miss ?
yes , please .
please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
excuse me , ma'am . can you tell me where the nearest postoffice is ?

do you mean that i go that way for one block , then turn right ?
yes , you are right .
is it far ?
no , it 's only about five minutes ' walk .
thank you very much .
could you give me some advice on how to bring up my son properly ?

but he always wimps out of difficulty .
i 'm in 507 . i have a few problems with my room .
what is that problem , sir ?
there are cockroaches in my room .
are you sure , sir ? flies i could believe , but cockroaches ?
i 've counted nine different cockroaches , and i accidentally stepped on another one .
sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
you dare to doubt me ?
excuse me , sir , i 'm afraid you ca n't park your car here .
why not ? it 's my parking space .
i 'm afraid not , sir .
oh ? that 's a surprise . let me see ... d 0411 our dog 's birthday . yes , i 'm sure this my parking space !
but i saw a red car always parking here before .
oh , we 've just repainted our car . it was red .
maybe . but the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
yeah . it used to . we got that fixed yesterday too .
could you wait for a minute , sir ? i 'd like to have a check .
sure , go ahead .
sorry , sir , my mistake . this is your parking space .
what can i do for you today ?
i need to buy a new refrigerator today .
were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
i like that kenmore refrigerator .
this particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
tell me about it .
not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
what are the appliances .
it has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
i 'd like to see it for myself .
go right ahead .
oh , well . it was fun to be the winner . but ... it 's too big . i must be an extra small in the states .
so what about the tennis racket ?
look ! it 's amazing . i ca n't wait to try it out !
how much did that end up costing you ?
oh ... around twenty bucks . a bargain if you ask me . look at the picture of her playing with it !

i appreciate your help .
would you like to have a seat over there ? it 'll just be a minute . and can i have your name ?
here 's my card .
hello , sir . you 're here to discuss the network settlement service , right ?
yes , that 's right . we want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .
yes , it 's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . to make full use of the network settlement service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few .
so , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
dear , time is up , let ’ s go there now .
just a minute . i ’ m putting on my clothes .
have you taken the key to the door ?
yes . oh , dear , i can ’ t find my hairbrushes . can you help me ?
where have you put it ?
i put it in the dressing room .
are you sure ?
yes , quite sure .
then , have you looked downstairs ?
yes , i ’ ve looked everywhere downstairs .
look , dear . it ’ s over there .
where ?
excuse me , sir . you ca n't park here .
i am just waiting for my friends . it wo n't be long .
sir , the curb here is not for parking .
but i did n't see the sign , ma ’ am .
there is a sign at the corner of the street . when you turned in here , you should have seen it .
i did n't see it .
are you a goal-oriented person ?
yes , i am . i always make a plan before i do anything .
where do you want to be in 5 years ?
i do n't want to have a specific title . i just want to enjoy what i am doing .
that sounds very reasonable .
it 's the most important thing to me .
if you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
that obviously depends on how things go - - whether i 'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
i want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . in order to achieve this goal , i just want to work step by step .
what is your long-range objective ?
i have n't thought it over at all .
what do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
i 'd like to open a current account .
certainly . may i see your social security and your id , please .
here you are . i wonder how much interest can i earn from a current account .
oh , current accounts do n't pay out interest .
why is that ?
it 's primarily designed for business transactions . that is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . we wo n't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .
good morning , helen .
good morning , steven .
so , what 's the status of our advertising campaign ?
it 'll be a national campaign starting next week .
what style will the ads be ?
i suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich .
sounds like a good idea . will we have a new slogan ?
i 'd like to taste some local dishes . what would you recommend ?
that 's fine . you must try this dish .
could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
it 's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
is it good ?
sure . it 's a most popular dish .
i think i 'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
we have two dressings for salad . which one would you like ?
what kind do you have ?
we have french and thousand island .
taxi !
where will you go , sir ?
friendship hotel .
ok , it 's not far from here .
i have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?

how much should i pay you ?
the reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
here 's 20 yuan , keep the change .
mr . johnson ’ s office . cindy speaking .
hi , cindy . it ’ s michael kurt . is mr . johnson in ?
no , i ’ m sorry , mr . kurt . he ’ s stepped out for a bit . would you like me to have him call you ?
hi , mark .
hi , bill . i ’ d like to take the apartment i looked at yesterday .
all right .
so , what do we do now ?
this is the lease . you should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . the lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
okay . ( reads the lease ) so , according to the lease , i ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and i have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . i understand that i ’ ll get the security deposit back when i move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
yes . if you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
can i pay you by check ?
sure . a check will be fine .
is there a laundry room in the basement ?
yes .
good morning ! what can i do for you ?
i 'm thinking of travelling to suzhou in july . could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?
with pleasure . we arrange two kinds of tourist programs for suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .
how much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
five hundred yuan .
does that include hotels and meals ?
oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
that sounds reasonable . what about the five-day flying journey ? how much is that ?
eight hundred and fifty yuan .
covering all expenses ?
i ca n't believe you wear jeans to the office ! are you trying to lose your job ?
of course not . i 'm just observing casual day . on fridays , the company does n't require us to wear formal business attire .
wow ! nobody told me about that . wo n't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
we do n't think so . casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
i guess it lets people express their individual tastes . but wo n't some people abuse it ?
not really . besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . people ca n't just wear whatever they want .
it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
abc company , my name is lucy . how can i help you ?
hello , lucy , this is monica . i ’ m calling for the accountant position . i saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . is it still available ?
thank you for your interest . the position is still available . have you already sent your cv to us ?
no , not yet . first , i want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information .
it is urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . if all these is not problem for you , i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
why did n't you go to school yesterday ?
i stayed home because i was n't feeling well .
what was your problem ?
my stomach was bothering me .
are you feeling any better ?
i 'm still feeling a little sick .
i 'm going to the store , would you like any pesto pistol ?
excuse me , but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray .
including my keys ?
yes , and please step over there .
all right . what shall i do now ?
just open your bags so we can check them . after that you can pick them up right behind that x-ray machine .
i 've got film in my bag .
that 's all right . this machine will not damage the film .
that 's fine .
can i have your boarding pass ? we need to stamp it .
sure . here you are .
thank you .
am i through now ?
yes . here is your boarding pass .
welcome to flash foot , sir.how can i help you ?
i ’ d like extra prints made of these photos .
do you have your negatives ?
yes.here they are . i ’ ve marked how many prints i want on each shot .
what size do you want the prints ?
four by six , except this one . i want a ten by thirteen print of this one .
is there anything i can do for you ?
i 'm interested in taking a tour to sydney .
well , we have a package tour there .
how much does it cost ?
$ 600 .
does that include the insurance ?
hello , mr . wang . i am glad to meet you here at the fair .
like wise . take a seat , please . how about a cup of tea ?
sure . thank you . it seems your business is prosperous . there are many customers here .
yes , it 's not too bad . our sales are going up year after year . and we still have a large potential production capacity .
well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?
that 's a good idea . so far , we have several agents abroad .
we are willing to be your agent in thailand for hand-held tools . what do you think ?
that sounds good .
then , what 's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .
4 % is too low , i think . you see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or tv , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . it all costs money , 4 % is not enough .
do n't worry . we 'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .
you mean to saya
it sounds ok . then how do you pay the commission ?
we may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
all right . if it 's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .
think it over . we hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
i 'm glad these batteries are on sale .
i 'm sorry . these batteries are not on sale .
but that 's what the ad said .
i 'm sorry . if you look at the ad again , you 'll see that the other brand is on sale .
oh . you 're right . i misread the ad .
yes , many people make that mistake .
well , you ca n't blame them . it 's a confusing ad .
you 're right . many ads are like that .
well , as long as i 'm here .
hi , jack , we are having a party tonight , wan na coming enjoy us ? you can bring your girlfriend , tina .
i do n't have a girlfriend . i 'm single .
oh , that 's right . well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .
no , i like being single . i never thought lonely , i 'm focus on my career . maybe i 'll start to look for my girl when i achieve success .
why is that ?
because i 'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . franklin speaking the girls i 've met wounld n't married a man wounld n't make enough money .
yes , sir ?
can i have mr . j . smith paged ? he said he 'd be in the main dining room . i 'm mr . j . b . white .
who would you like to have paged again , sir ?
mr . j . smith .
where would you like him to come ?
to the front desk .
can you help me find a lotion for a problem i am having ?
that ’ s what i am here for . what questions can i answer for you ?
i have poison oak , and i need help with the rash that won ’ t stop itching .
the best product is techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
which one is best ?
the cream form is very popular .
can i do anything else to help with the itching ?
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
excuse me . something is wrong with my bank card . can you help me ?
yes . what 's the problem ?
just a mistake with my name . it should be issued as steven , but the card is under the name ' steven ' .
oh , i am very sorry about that . it 's our fault . i will arrange someone to correct it immediately .
ok , no problem . to err is human .
anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .

this is very annoying .
i 'm sorry , sir . do you wish to try something else ? that would be on the house , of course .
no , i do n't risk it .

i must 've missed it .
is this your first time flying ?
yes . i 'm going to san francisco .
oh , it 's a beautiful city . i think you 'll like it .

thanks . by the way , my name is mary .

yes , you are right .
and you 'd take some exercise every day .
hello mrs parker , how have you been ?
hello dr peters . just fine thank you . ricky and i are here for his vaccines .
very well . let 's see , according to his vaccination record , ricky has received his polio , tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old , so he is due for hepatitis a , chickenpox and measles shots .
what about rubella and mumps ?
well , i can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks i can administer the rest .
ok , great . doctor , i think i also may need a tetanus booster . last time i got it was maybe fifteen years ago !
i ’ m interested in teaching at your school .
great . are you a qualified teacher ?
yes .
what kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
i have a tefl certificate .
how many years of experience do you have ?
i have three years of teaching esl and four years of teaching per-school children .
when did you get your tefl certificate ?
i got my tefl certificate three years ago .
why do you want to teach at our school ?
well , i ’ ve heard many good things about it . i also like teaching young children .
that ’ s great . can you speak chinese ?
yes , just a little .
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
i sure can .
why is the car before us stopping ?
what 's going on ?
look . two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . that 's why that car stops .
more and more people easily get irritated while driving .
this is today ’ s schedule . at 8 thirty am , conference with the department managers . at 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives .
that ’ s great . what are the prizes ?
3000 rib as bonus for each person .
to encourage the staff increases .
ok . next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 am . at 12 am , back here for lunch .
what about the afternoon ?
this is lincoln bank , consumer credit department . how can i help you ?
ah , hello . i 'm calling to find out how i apply for a car loan .
we offer a personal automobile consumer loan . the application process is pretty straight forward . i trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?
yes , i do . it 's ready and waiting in my account .
the next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...
could i just stop you there ? sorry to interrupt , but i have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car i want .
that will certainly cut down the processing time . we can move on to the next step . do you have the purchase price ?
yes , it 's 110,000 rib . so , with the down payment done , i will need to borrow 70,000 rib .
what we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , id card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .
hi , my name is tom .
tom , the new sales representative ? nice to meet you ! i 'm melinda .
nice to meet you too.melinda .
now let me show you around . this is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . over here is the sales department .
really ? this is a nice office , but it 's quite small .
yeah ... you can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
it looks like you guys work hard .
i tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.just kidding . oh , your cubicle is over the . and this way . those are all private offices the managers offices .
hmm ... tell me more details about our jobs .
what do you think of our price ?
your price has gone up sharply , has n't it ?
yes . we regret we can not maintain our original price . since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
i agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
i do n't think so . you must compare our price with that of other export houses . i 'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
i do n't think we 'll be able to pay the price . to have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
i ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
do n't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
we 've already cut down our price to cost level .
is that all ?
yes , this is the best we can do .
so , jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?
it ’ s great , dad . i don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .
even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .
i ’ ve never had a bank account before . why don ’ t i just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
you know you would spend it . and also , money in the bank earns interest .
but what if i need my money suddenly ?
the bank will give you a pin , and you can withdraw money from any atm .
great ! so it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
not quite . you have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . and sometimes the bank has service charges . but you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . let ’ s go make your first depot
is this where i can catch a bus to the theater ?
yes , but you ca n't get there with out a change .
which bus do i have to change ?
you have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
here we are , joan . this is the palace museum , also known as the forbidden city .
oh , how splendid ! can you take a picture of me here ?
excuse me . i 'm afraid i got lost . where am i on this map ?
we are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .
oh ! can i go from here to the zhongshan park ?
tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?
working hours are from 8 : 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . be sure not to be late or absent . report to the manager by filling in the ' monthly report ' every month .
is there anything else ? how about my salary ?
our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . on the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee 's past attendance record .
wow , thank you for telling me these . do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
all new members are likely to ask the same questions . haha . i can understand that . every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . after you 've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . the leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
kate , you never believe what 's happened .
what do you mean ?
masha and hero are getting divorced .
you are kidding . what happened ?
well , i do n't really know , but i heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
that 's really surprising . i always thought they are well matched . what about the kids ? who get custody ?
masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
that 's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . well , i still ca n't believe it , masha and hero , the perfect couple . when would they divorce be final ?
overseas operator .
i would like to make a collect call to taipei , taiwan , please .
your name , please .
tim chen .
what 's the number , please .
the area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
hello . excuse me .
yes . can i help you ?
do you remember me ? i just had lunch here a half hour ago .
of course i remember you .
i think i lost my wallet here .
oh , no . really ? i did n't see anything .
really ? you did n't find a wallet ?
no , i did n't . would you like to go look by the table with me ?
yes , i would . it 's not here . and it 's not on the floor.has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
no . it 's been empty the whole time .
hmm . i do n't know how it could have happened .
i remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.you did n't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
no . my friend did .
then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
no , i 'm not sure . but i usually take out my wallet when i sit down.it ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . so i usually put it next to me on the table .
maybe you lost it before you came here . or maybe you left it at home .
i do n't think it 's at home . i think i had it when i left the house.but what should i do ?
well , the first thing you should do is make sure it 's not at home.then , if it is n't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver 's license , things like that .
should i call the police ?
you can if you want . but the police usually do n't do anything about lost wallets .
hmm . i 'll go home and check . maybe you 're right . maybe it 's at home .
i 'm sorry we could n't find it , sir .
good morning , young lady . you can call me ma . do you see anything you like ?
yes . many things ! i especially love this beautiful quilt .
that quilt was passed down to me from my ma in holland .
it sounds like a special quilt . why do you want to sell it ?
well , this home is too big for me now , so i 'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . therefore , i need to part with a few things .
oh , i see . umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?
have you got change for a thousand ?
may i come in , mr sun ?
i ’ d rather you didn ’ t , miss yang . i ’ m very busy now .
can i try later then ?
yes , of course .
is it all right for me to come in now , mr sun ?
well , uh ... i ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . come in . what can i do for you ?
do you mind if i sit down ?
not at all . take a seat . now what can i do for you ?
i want to leave the department . do you think i could put info a transfer ?
yes . but why should you want to do that ?
do you mind if i speak frankly ?
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see , i don ’ t like the office . i don ’ t like the staff . and i ’ m afraid of you . and i don ’ t want to go one . so may i put info a transfer ?
where is that ?
take me to the airport , please .
are you in a hurry ?
i have to be there before 17 o'clock .
we 'll make it except a jam . you know it 's rush hour .
there 's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
i 'll do my best .
here 's twenty dollars .
do you have small bills ?
no . if you ca n't break it , keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
recently i have been getting headache and my eyes do n't seems to see focus properly .
when did you last time have your eyes checked ?
two years ago . at that time i had no problems.now i can ’ t even make out something ten meters away .

just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . you should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .
it is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .
you 'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .
the contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . and the length depends on the particular situation .
only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .
to sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .
selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .
it should also be truthful and realistic . do not blindly blow your own horn .
you should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .
while you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately
time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .
hello ?
hi , deborah ! this is john . i 'm calling from australia .
what are you doing in australia ?
i 'm attending a conference in sydney this week . remember ?
oh , right . what time is it there ?
it 's 10:00 p . m . and it 's four o'clock in los angeles , right ?
yes - four o'clock in the morning .
4:00 a . m . ? i 'm really sorry .
john has n't turned up and stefan is ill . do we have anyone on stand-by ?
jack , let ’ s go !
oh , you are out of breath ! what happened ?
some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible !
hello . may i speak to jerry , please ?
sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .
i see . can you give me some idea how long he 'll be back ?
i think he will be back around 2:00 . if you like , please leave your name and phone number , i 'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
that 's nice . my name is steven , my phone number is 6789777 . okay , i 'll be waiting for his call . thank you and bye !
excuse me , miss .
what can i do for you ?
i 've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
what 's your flight number ?
flight ca216 to chengdu .
yes , it 's true . it has been delayed .
could you please tell me why ?
yes , of course . the delay is due to heavy rain .
how long will the delay be ? do you have any further information about it ?
i am sorry , we do n't know the extent of the delay at present . but according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
we have to wait . well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
it 's hard to say . weather is so changeable in the summer . please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
yes , i will . thanks a lot . bye !
what are we going to do ? i ca n't get the car out of this ditch . i 'm stuck !
i 'm worried , tom . i have n't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
i know . this is terrible . what can we do ? this snow does n't stop falling !
i told you we should have stayed in town today.the weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.why did you want to come up here ?
i wanted to show you the cabin . we only had another half-hour to go .
well , now we 're stuck . what can we do ?
i do n't know .
i 've heard that when this happens , it 's important to save energy .
what do you mean ?
we 're stranded here , tom . we may be here a long time.we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car 's energy is what will keep us warm .
i have plenty of gas .
yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.we ca n't just let the car run and run.if we do , it will die soon . then we 'll freeze .
so what can we do ?
turn the lights off.then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
alright . that 's a good idea .
i wish we had n't come up here . now we 'll probably be here for days .
days ?
yes , it happens.that is what happens in big snowstorms . people get stranded for days .
oh , my god ! it 's good we have food .
hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?
oh , sorry . i didn ’ t know .
what ? you haven ’ t taken the bus before ?
no , i ’ m afraid not .
well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . besides , you should let old people on first .
sorry .
it ’ s all right . where are you going ?
i wanted to see the white house .
oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . it goes to georgetown .
oh , no .
it ’ s all right , though . just get off at the next stop and catch the 79a .
oh , well thank you very much .
can i help you ?
i 'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .
what kind of drink would you like with that ?
just coke will be fine .
would you like a super size meal ? only 2 rib more , you 'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . and today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
that sounds good , thanks , i 'd like that . actually i 'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
that 's not a problem , miss . will that be it ?
yes , that 's all .
that will be 25rmb , please
do you have any night tours ?
yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .
is that a guided tour ?
yes , it is .
i am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .
that 's nice .
we hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
i would like to purchase some meat .
what kind of meat would you like to get today ?
first off , i 'm going to need a pound of ground beef .
a pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
that 's perfect .
what else will you be needing ?
i 'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .
the chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
what 's the total price for the chicken ?
it 's going to be $ 12.15 .
i think you know already that i want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .
yes , mr . bergeron . you mentioned that in your letter . to tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .
is that so ? anyhow i want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . our firm specializes in this line of business . we have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the european market .
do you sell direct to shops ?
yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . we have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
do you keep a stock of these things ?
in some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in london and act as distributors as well as agents . generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . we are paid for our service , of course .
that is , your commission .
yes , our commission is very reasonable . we usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .
our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and tv programs . a 10 % commission will not leave us much .
according to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?
we will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
we appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . but our suggestion to you , mr . bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
mr . bergeron , you leave us no alternative . we can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole european market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . besides our price is worked out according to the costing . a 10 % commission means an increase in our price . we must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .
oh , that 's just too bad . i intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . to start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
ah , mrs . miller , but in this case am i covered ?
oh , yes . we will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .
all right , but i 'll be back again for the autumn fair . and then i hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
have you worked out the offers . mr . thou ?
yes , we have . here 's our cif quotation sheet . please have a careful look .
are the prices on the list firm offers ?
yes . all the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
i wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
all these products are our best-selling lines . the prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . and we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . what do you have in mind ?
how long does your offer remain valid ? i need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
we have been over this a hundred times ! we are not getting a pet !
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
we ’ re planning on having children soon , i don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let ’ s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ’ ll tell you what , i can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
good evening , mr . lee and thank you for choosing our airline . we have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?
overbooked ? give up my seat ? i don ’ t understand .
from time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . that ’ s overbooked .
i know what overbooked is , i just don ’ t understand how that could happen ?
actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
so who has to stay behind ?
well , first we ask for volunteers . if someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . if no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
i want to rent this apartment .
i ’ m glad to hear that .
how much are you asking ?
you will have to pay $ 1050 every month .
i can ’ t afford that .
what can you afford ?
i was thinking $ 800 a month .
i ’ ll need you to pay more than that .
how much more ?
how does $ 900 every month sound to you ?
i can live with that .
good morning , miss monica . nice to meet you again !
good morning , mr . thomas , it is nice to see you too .
after the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . so , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . what is your expected salary ?
i ’ ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . depend on my work qualifications and experience , i would like to have 5000 yuan to start .
the basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance .
it is a bit lower than i expected . but i can accept that . what are the working hours ?
40 hours a week , monday to friday , 9 am to 5 pm with one hour lunch break every day ..
do i have to work on weekend ? if so , how do you pay for the overtime ?
we do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like spring festival and the mid-autumn day .
is there probation ?
welcome to the mcdonald 's . what will it be for you , madam ?
one big mac and french fries .
is there anything else ?
give me one coke , please .
is this to go or to eat here ?
to go , please .
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
and can i have some ketchup , please ?
what 's the name of this street ?
university street .
do you know of any banks near here ?
excuse me.could you tell me how to return to the hilton hotel ? i am afraid i lost my way .
do you have a hotel card or something ?
let 's see.yes , i have the address and telephone number here .
oh , you 're staying at the downtown hilton.then , you go down two blocks this way and turn left.you ' ll find it on the right .
excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a ten-minute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
how does the political system work in your country ?
we have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . most people call them mp ’ s .
each mp belongs to a political party , right ?
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime finist
what ’ s a cabinet ?
this is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted , it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
how was your interview ?
pretty good . the hr manager asked me the usual questions . then he wondered why i had decided to leave my previous job .
what did you say ?
i told him that i hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . i also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .
did he want to know the reasons ?
yes . i told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . but i thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
that ’ s sex discrimination . when will you get the reply ?
in a couple of days , i was told .
wish you good luck !
what qualities do you think a senior executive should possess ?
generally speaking , he needs creativity , the ability to communicate , sense of personal responsibilities , the ability to solve problems and so on .
do you have all these qualities ?
hi . i need more amenities , please .
could you be a little more specific , sir ?
well , to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo .
i understand . now , you 're saying that you 've already used up all your amenities ?
oh , no ! i 've got all i need for my stay here .
so , what 's the problem ?
i need souvenirs !
you want some souvenirs !
yes , yes . souvenirs .
but , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
that 's not the same thing . if you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
are you ready to order ? may i suggest a veal ?
no , i 'll have the fish please .
the chicken is also nice .
no , i want the fish .
our special tonight is lobster .
thank you , but i prefer the fish .
perhaps you 'd enjoy the lamb .
no , i like the fish .

good morning , vera , nice to meet you .
kate , i know you ’ ve been a stewardess for more than one year . and i ’ ll have an interview on stewardess tomorrow . can you tell me some etiquette about the interview ?
of course . first you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick .
is there anything else i should pay attention to ?
yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . you should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . do n't move from time to time when you sit there . and you also should know how to use eye contact .

i see . ok .
how would you like to make the payment ?
in cash , please . here you are .
thank you , sir ... here is your change . could you check it , please ? thank you for choosing our hotel . i hope you enjoyed your stay .
by the way , please forward my mail to this address .
hi , sam . i want to buy a pet . do you have any ideas ?
you really should go to rachel 's pet store .
why ? anything special there ?
it 's more than special . you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it 's a world of exotic pets .
that 's terrific . i ca n't wait to check it out .
hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
why not ? it 's so cool .
but it will pose a risk to your health .
pardon ?
i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
well , i did n't realize that .
i do n't believe it 's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
oh , i should have thought of my brother 's baby girl . maybe i 'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
i ’ m a new student . my name ’ s robert .
nice to meet you . my name ’ s sophie .
are you french ?
yes , i ’ m . are you french , too ?
no , i ’ m not .
what nationality are you ?
i ’ m italian . are you a teacher ?
no , i ’ m not .
what ’ s your job ?
i ’ m a keyboard operator . what ’ s your job ?
i can ’ t believe obama is our president .
i am proud to know that he is our president .
you voted for him , right ?
did you vote for him , because i know that i did .
i did , too .
i have nothing but faith in obama .
really ?
i ’ m sure he will help better america .
we do need some change in this country .
our country is already changing as it is .
you ’ re absolutely right .
do you have a reservation , sir ?
no , i ’ m afraid we don ’ t .
i ’ m sorry the restaurant is full now . you have to wait for about half an hour . would you like to have a drink at the lounge until there ’ s a table available .
no , thanks , i ’ ll come back later . may i reserve a table for two ?
yes , of course . may i have your name , sir ?
bruce by the way , can we have a table by the window ?
we ’ ll try to arrange it , but i can ’ t guarantee sir .
that ’ s fine .
do you have coffee shops in china , too ?
yes , of course . there are many tea houses and bars in china , too . people can drink , eat and relax at these places .
you like to go to these places , don ’ t you ?
yes , sometimes the music there is so beautiful . it is very romantic . i can stay there for hours .
do you often go there alone ?
hi there ! i am looking for a new car . i have this old ford pinto that i would like to trade in .
i see . you are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year .
perfect ! i like this one .
that is the ford focus . a very light but powerful vehicle . it comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
sounds like a good car ! how many miles to the gallon ?
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what ’ s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , trust me , this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable mam . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
i wonder if you could help me , i 'm looking for a room .
well , i have got a vacancy .
what sort of price are you asking ?
eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry .
would it be convenient to see the room ?
iba , jane speaking . how can i help you ?
hello . i 'd like to speak to someone regarding my card .
sorry , i 'm not quite sure if i understand . in what way , sir ? has your card been stolen ?
no , no . nothing at all like that . it 's just that i applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but i 'm still waiting for my card .
oh , i see , sir . well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
yes , my application was accepted last friday . now it 's wednesday , that 's more than 5 days .
sorry , sir , but it 's 5 working days . this does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .
of course ! how silly of me ! yes , 5 working days would mean this friday , at the earliest . i see . i 'm sorry to trouble you .
it 's no trouble at all , sir . is there anything else i can help you with today ?
what can i do for you , sir ?
we 'd like to order breakfast for tomorrow morning .
yes , sir . what would you like ?
orange juice , scrambled eggs , bacon , toast and coffee .
ok , and when shall i bring it here ?
about seven thirty.by the way , could you also bring me tomorrow 's papers ?
what shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ?
you should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company .
shall we leave it to the brokers ?
yes . they usually do it .
do they charge for that ?
of course . in europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
is it the same in america ?
they do the work without charge to the importer .
it 's part of their service , is n't it ?
exactly .
is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
no , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
i see . by the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
you must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
i see . thank you .
i 'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ?
ok , mum , when will you be back ?

whoa whoa whoa ! are you nuts ? how much is all this going to cost ? i ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! this is basically a crayon !

no !

you 'd better get up , or you 'll be late .
what 're you talking about ? my alarm even has n't gone off yet .

i must have slept right through it .

how much are you asking ?
10.00 dollars a night .
could i see the room , please ?
sit down , please . what 's wrong with you ?
i feel cold , and i 'm shivering . i have a terrible headache and a sore throat .

not so good .
now , let me take your temperature . please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ?
your pulse is weak .
do i have a temperature , doctor ?
yikes ! what was that noise ?
i had to blow my nose .
did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
did you hear that ?
of course i heard that . i thought a plane had crashed into your house .
it was n't that loud .
i will blow my nose sometime for you , and you 'll see .

nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . so i am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .
what you said is true . but the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . for example , to make more movie ccds , so people will spend money buying them .
but it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
okay , well i ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .
yes , well miss childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details i ’ d like to clarify .

i understand . and are there other bonuses included ?
well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . but we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
well , mr . parsons , i am flexible when it comes to salary . the opportunity to work in hong kong for you is the most important thing for me .
we need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . but do n't worry , it wo n't cause too much inconvenience . we 're going to do it over the weekend .

it has been seasonal during these past three years .

are you having any luck ?
not really . there are n't any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i 'll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining , but i had a problem the other day at kimble 's department store .
what happened ?
do you do a lot of your shopping online ?
not really . i like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i ’ m buying before i pay for it . sometimes , i ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat
no . i ’ m a little worried about security . you never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . aren ’ t you worry about that ?
not really . i know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities , i don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho
i ’ m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but i don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so , how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i ’ d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .

would you like to try my special recipe ?
wow , let me try . it tastes nice . how did you make it ?
mr . dick . does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?
yes . in fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . in the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . if your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .
but i find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . so i doubt its authority .
more and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . if your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .
could you tell me whether or not i send out my resume with it ?
taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the internet ?
just fill out an application .
do i have to send an e-mail ?
you are expected to know the e-mail address of the unit .

send out an application through job-wanted on the website .
can any unit see my information ?
it 's a two-way choice . and your application will be read .
which websites offer this service ?
sina , 21st century talent net , and a few others .
don ’ t throw your weight around . i can ’ t bear you any more .

yes . i was propaganda department minister of our university .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
no . it ’ s a pity about it .
were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
yes . i was a member of the basketball society . i like playing basketball .
what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
you want to argue your ticket today ?
yes . that is why i 'm here .
tell me your argument .
i was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
are you sure you were n't speeding ?
to be honest , i really was n't .
what speed were you going ?
i was under the speed limit . i was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
i 'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer is n't here .
what about my ticket ? do i still need to pay ?
do n't worry about it .
annie , do you like shopping online ?
yes , i like it , because it 's convenient .

are there many things online ?
sure . you can find everything all over the world . let 's check it out online ! ( they log in a shopping website . )
that 's amazing . oh , an on line virtual supermarket ?
let 's click to check it out .
ah , bob . just the person i wanted to see .
so what is it ?
you got ta help me out this time , buddy .
hey ! what happened ? ! my song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .
i do n't know what happened !

thank you . could you show us to our table now ?
would you please follow me , please ?
thank you .
hello , ma ’ am . can i help you ?
i ’ m looking for a sweater .
what size are you looking for ?
well , i ’ m looking for size 10 but you don ’ t have it .
how about this one ? i think it looks terrific on you .
yes , i like the color . can i try it on ?
sure . the fitting room is on your right .
it fits well . i like it a lot . what do you think ?
you look pretty in red .
oh , it ’ s my favorite . how much is it ?
$ 29.99 .
okay . i ’ ll take it . thank you very much for your help .

it 's 40 $ plus tax per day on limited mileage .
i 'm going to need it for three days .

sure , here is my driver 's license .
are you ready to order ?
i think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order .
let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp .
i was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .
the chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .
i am a vegetarian . do you have any vegetarian selections ?
you could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .
i think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .
that is a good selection , and i can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree .

what kind of character do you think you have ?
generally speaking , l am an open-minded person .
what is your strongest trait ?
cheerfulness and friendliness .
how would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
they say mr . sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
what personality do you admire ?
i admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
how do you get along with others ?
hi , i need to make an appointment to see the doctor .
what seems to be the problem ?
i have a rash that i need a doctor to look at .
do you have a fever with that rash ?
no , it just itches a lot .
i have openings on tuesday or wednesday . which would be best for you ?
i need an appointment on tuesday .
fine , i am putting you down for 9
i would like to see dr . jones .
wow ! what 's the hold up ?
it ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . nobody sticks around in the summer .
really ? then , i guess i won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend .

quality is very important to us . we work to very low tolerance levels . we need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . over the years we 've built up very good relationships with our suppliers .
do you have many different suppliers ?

you 'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise .
now , tell me what you often eat .
i often eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes , and fruits . i love fruits very much .
what do you like to drink ?
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
whatever would you like to drink ?
i drink a lot of milk . i drink milk almost every day .
how often do you exercise ?
well , i walk every day .
it 's a good diet and a regular exercise .
i am sorry , but i can not stay for the rest of class today .
why do you need to leave early ?
i don ’ t feel so good .
what doesn ’ t feel right ?
i feel as if i am going to be sick to my stomach .
perhaps you should get checked out at the student health center before you go home .
i have some medicine at home that i could take .
are you going to be ok to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
your boyfriend is so considerate to you . when do you plan to marry ?
we 're considering of ordering 200 computers , but i 'm wondering about the price you 'll possibly offer .
our price will be not less than $ 5000 .
your price is higher than i expected . could you give us a little discount ?
this is already our best price .
but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
well , what would you suggest ?
could you make it $ 4500 ?
i 'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . this is the best price we can quote .
can we meet each other half way ?
what do you mean ?
let 's close the deal at $ 4800 , ok ?
i 'm now on the songshan airport getting ready for departure . i realized that i might have left my watch .

what problems ?
i did notice a few stains in the carpet .
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
you will ?
yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
that was the only thing that i saw that was wrong with the apartment .
i ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
that china-gown of tang-dynasty style is so beautiful . would you show it to me , please ?
absolutely . here it is .
could i try it on ?
please do , the fitting-room is over there .
it feels a little tight around the waist . do you have a bigger one ?
i 'm sorry . we do n't have this color in your size . we have some green ones in your size . would you please have a look at this green one ?
ok . how much does it cost ?
mrs . wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
as i said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . we hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
just to comply , we 're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . i hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .
so do we . certainly it 's a step forward on your side . but the gap is still too wide .
the ball is in your court , mrs.wang . what price would you suggest ?
to make your offer workable , i think you should take another step down as big as the one you 've just taken .
that wo n't do . you see , our profit margin is very narrow . it simply ca n't stand such a big cut .
i hate to disappoint you , mr . brown , but if that 's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . do think it over , please . we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
well , i 'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . would you mind waiting a day or two , until i get a reply from the home office ?
not at all . shall we meet again , say , on friday morning ?
good morning .
good morning.this is mary.can i speak to anne please ?
i ’ m sorry she isn ’ t in at the momment.she will come back at half past ninecan i take a message for her ?
thank you.but i will call her later
ok.goodbye .

i 'm afraid we 'll be late for the party .

yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
but you bought it only last month .
yes , but ever since i bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so i ' ve got to have it repaired .
how long will it take us to get there ?
i think about ten minutes by bus .
it 's not far away , then . let 's walk , it 's beginning to rain .
hi , mr . smith . i 'm doctor hawkins . why are you here today ?
i found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
yes , well , you have n't had one for 5 years . you should have one every year .
i know . i figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . so try to come at least once a year for your own good .
ok .
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath , please . do you smoke , mr . smith ?
yes .
smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . you really should quit .
i 've tried hundreds of times , but i just ca n't seem to kick the habit .
well , we have classes and some medications that might help . i 'll give you more information before you leave .
good afternoon . mr . tylor 's office ?
i 'm afraid you 've got the wrong extension .
i 'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to mr . tylor 's office ?
sure , please hold on .
thank you .
now mr . tylor 's on the line . go ahead , please .
you are so kind , you helped me a lot .
good afternoon , lexington software . angelina dawson , how can i help ?
hello , this is quinn from iba .
ah , hello quinn . oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , are n't you ?
i 'm afraid so , yes .
hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
unfortunately it 's rather a big mistake .
what do you recommend we do ?
i would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
oh ! ! ! i have a horrible toothache .
you should go to the dentist .
i hate dentists .
well , suffer then . if you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
it always hurts . i hate going .
stop being such a baby . if it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
o . k . , o . k . , i ’ ll go .
i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .
a trip to the beach would be fun . how is the weather going to be ?
the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
so do you think it 'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
it sounds like it will be .
i really hope it does n't get cold .
that would ruin things , i want to go so badly .
the weather in california is unpredictable , so you never know .
that is true . the weather is constantly changing .
it would be nice if the weather would never change .
that would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . people spend so much time at work . it is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .
if we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
beneficial ? i don ’ t think so . if two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . if they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . by any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
but if two employees are in love , they will be happy . happy people are more productive . if they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . it can help to improve work efficiency .
do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . and anyway , i believe if you live a low stress life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . it 's all in the mind .
you have the point . i think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
what 's special about these things ?
cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it 's very acidic . wild rice is high in fibre so it 's good for your guts and it 's high in protein and minerals-i think it 's also tastier than normal rice . yoghurt 's good because it 's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . people have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
i 've been so tired recently . i 've been trying , but i do n't think i 'm up to this job .
you need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
oh , yes , indeed . i 've run out of steam . to be honest , i want to be in a different environment .
is that so ?
yes , i do n't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes . i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh , that 's terrible . do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
i 'm afraid not . i 've promised my girlfriend . we 'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
ok , i 'd like to say that i 've really enjoyed working with you . however , i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
thank you so much for your advice .
and every best wish for your new job .
the train is leaving . hurry up ! which car are we in ?
let me see . oh , no . 11 .
here we are , car 11 . let 's get in .
seats no . 20 and 21 . it ’ s nice that we ’ ve got a window seat .
let 's put our suitcases on the rack .
oh , the baggage rack is full . put them under the seat for the time being .
so , how should we get to the theatre ?
let 's take the bus .
i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
it 's not that bad . you probably just had a bad experience once .
it was n't just once . every single time i take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
we could take the subway , but we 'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
if we do n't hurry up , we 'll miss the show . should we take the bus ?
we 're already late , so i think we had better take a taxi .
i do n't think we 'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . let 's just take the bus .
fine . have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . do n't worry . nothing bad will happen . i 'll even buy your ticket for you .
thanks , that was nice of you .
let 's go over this plan again .
from vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to winnipeg .
and that is mostly flat , right ?
relatively , once we 're out of alberta , anyway . then it 's hills again in aitoba .
and from winnipeg we go around the lakes through toronto , right ?
that 's right . and up in to quebec . and that 's where we stop .
it does n't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that 's a long , long ride .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ?
i 'm bill . i 'm in room 908 . can you change the room for me ? it 's too noisy . my wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . she said it was too much for her .
i 'm awfully sorry , sir . i do apologize . room 908 is at the end of the corridor . it 's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .
anyhow , i 'd like to change our room .
no problem , sir . we 'll manage it , but we do n't have any spare room today . could you wait till tomorrow ? the american people-to-people education delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . there 'll be some rooms for you to choose from .
all right . i hope we 'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
it 's time for bed .
i 'm not ready to go to sleep . i 'm not tired .
it 's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .
i 'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
why do n't you try counting sheep ?
i 've tried that before . it really does n't work .
that 's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .
why ca n't i just stay up until i fall asleep ?
if i let you do that , then you 're just going to be up all night .
i promise i 'll go to sleep soon .
no , you 're going to sleep now , so good night .
i see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . and i have a strong sense of responsibility .
how about your psychological resilience ?
i think i can work well under pressure , if necessary .
how would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
i will just be sincere and friendly to others , and i believe they will treat me the same way .
you seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
thank you . i simply believe the goodness of human nature .
please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
karen ? i need to go over a few things with you .
certainly . mr . graham . when would you like to meet ?
i was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
i believe we ' ve met before . my name 's david .
yes , at your company , i think . i 'm frank .
oh , i remember now.very nice to meet you again .
i made my little brother cry .
i need some mascara . do you have good thickening mascara ?
of course . here is our thickening mascara . we also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
alright . and i want to consider your eye shadow too . do you have a color chart can look at ?
we have a very wide selection of colors . and our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . so it is very gentle on your eyelids . would you like to sample some ?
oh , sure i will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
i can help you with that .
is this the baggage claim area for flight kb256 ?
yes , we are on the same plane .
but i am a transfer passenger . i have a connecting flight to miami .
so you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
yes.it ' s quite troublesome .
billy , you don ’ t look too well . maybe you should take the day off school .
but mom ! today we ’ re playing football ! i love football !
you ’ ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . what ’ s that on your arm ?
i don ’ t know . it was there when i woke up this morning .
it ’ s rash . i ’ d better take you to see the doctor . how did you get that bruise on your leg ?
i bashed it against the chair in my room .
does it hurt ?
a little , but not much .
here . put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . i ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .
if i ’ m better this afternoon , can i go to school ?
this is your schedule .
you 're going out of your way for us , i believe .
are there any vacancies still available ?
yes . we need a plumber here .
i am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there 's something wrong with the fax machine .
what 's wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ?
yes , very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed , so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ?
i would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind .
what would you like to speak to me about ?
i would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election .
is that right ?
i am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign .
that ’ s wonderful . i am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
i know history is about to be made , and i would like to be a part of it .
that ’ s fantastic .
are you planning on voting ?
i ’ m going to vote .
go to your polling place early on election day .
we hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .
yes . i promise it will not happen again .
we look forward to your settlement at an early date .
hello , steven . how do you get along with your job ?
actually , i learn many things from it . i find that i am a quick learner in new things .
practice makes perfect . by the way , what do you learn from your job ?
at first i did n't know anything about the machine . now i know how to operate it . besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
yeah , you are a good learner . i must commend you for your good performance .
thank you . that 's a long way to go for my job .
i appreciate your effort very much . the coffee break is over ; it 's about time we set to work .
where on earth are we ?
judging by all the traffic , i 'd say we 're near the outskirts of the city .
what did i do wrong ? did i take a wrong turn ?
i 'm not sure , but i think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
hello . front desk .
yes . this is bob robinson . i ’ m calling from room number 627 .
hi , bob . what can i do for you ?
is it possible to change to another room ?
could you please tell me why ?
my room is facing the swimming pool . it ’ s noisy for me . i have a problem sleeping . and i feel uncomfortable when i take an elevator .
so you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .
you ’ re right .
okay . let me check for a room on the first floor .
thank you .
i ’ ve only two rooms on the first floor . how about room 108 ?
that ’ s fine . can i move now ?
sure . i ’ ll send the bellman to help you .
oh , thank you kindly .
how long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
let 's see . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles .
fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we do n't run into any problems with the border control .
now you 're my boss , mr . henry .
do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
no , nothing in particular .
you may ask questions about us , if you have any .
what are you doing here today ?
i would like to fight my ticket .
is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
yes , the officer is here today .
what 's your case ?
i was pulled over for running a red light , but i never did .
do you believe that the officer lied ?
there was a camera on the signal . so , he was obviously lying .
your license plate was caught on camera ?
a picture of my license plate was never taken .
since there is no picture of your license plate on record , i 'm going to let you go .
hey joe , what are you doing in this department store ?
hi , rita , i 'm just looking for a pair of shoes . i wo n't be here for long .
why not ? when i go shoe shopping , i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
that 's my problem . i do n't have a lot of options .
what do you mean ? this is a big store , is n't it ?
yes , but i have unusually big feet . that would n't be too much of a problem except that they 're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that i can fit into .
so how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
well , first of all , i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
well , you 're in the right store . if they do n't have it , no one will .
what shall we do after the volleyball match ?
how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym .
that 's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
me , too . what did you have in mind ?
i have n't decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they 're very lovely , especially `` huan huan `` .
is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they 're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh , i see . if i buy more than a set , can i get any discount ?
i do n't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
mom ! i hate eating vegetables !
you don ’ t have to eat them . i don ’ t mind .
thanks mom ! can i have dessert now ? i love chocolate cake !
no dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
but i don ’ t like them ! it ’ s not fair !
you can have some fruit for dessert . if you eat an apple and a banana , i might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
ok ... actually , i don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy i hate broccoli and cauliflower .
i ’ ll remember that for next time . you ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . ok ?
it was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . it gave me a good idea of your product range .
it ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . what ’ s your general impression , may i ask ?
very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your nw model .
that ’ s our latest development . a product with high performance . we put it on the market just two months ago .
the machine gives you an edge over your competitors , i guess .
certainly . no one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
could you give me some brochures for that machine ? and the price if possible .
right . here is our sales catalog and literature .
is the factory fully-automated ?
not completely . our production process is partially-automated . we use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
what about supply of parts to the production line ?
well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . and there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
what about the smaller components ?
i 'm glad you 're on your ten-year reunion planning committee .
yeah , you get the tv to yourself while i spend my nights surfing the net for missing classmates .
that 's not why . this way i can see how you guys do this sort of thing .
i guess . do n't you have reunions in taiwan ?
definitely . every year . but just for our forty-person class .
what does your job involve ?
how many languages can you speak ?
besides chinese , i can speak english and french .
you mean you can read and write both of them ?
no , i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of english-speaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
what can i get for you ? here is the menu .
let me have a look . well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ?
we have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak .
is there something go with the filet steak ?
are you ready to go shopping ?
just a minute . i need to make a list of thinks that we need .
good idea . have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
i don ’ t have onions on my list . i ’ ll add them . we should get some tea . is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
let ’ s get both . we need some coffee too . is that on your list ?
yes , it is . here ’ s my list . is there anything that i ’ ve forgotten ?
i think you ’ ve got everything . i want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
what kind of cheese do you want .
i ’ m not sure . i ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when i can see what they have . have we got enough money ?
we don ’ t have enough cash , so i ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . where are the car keys ?
hello , can you tell me how to use the telephone ?
if you want to order meals , call 8801.if you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there .
thank you so much . by the way , is there a mail service ?
how many years have you done business with china ?
let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with hua mei of china import & export corporation in 2003 .
do you have any difficulties in doing business in china ? you know the chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?
i do n't think i have any problem with our chinese partners . they have always followed the contract strictly . we can do business directly with the corporation . as i mentioned before , the chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
well , it 's known that the sino-american relation is in a dilemma . does it influence your business in china ?
actually not at present . but we are afraid it will . you know policies influence business to some extent . i hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . china is really a large market . we do n't want to lose it .
thank you .
give me a pack of first-class stamps , please .
here you are . that will be five dollars . anything else ?
yes . i want some post cards and some airmail stamps . i want to send some letters to south america .
just a moment , i 'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to south america .
can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to colombia ? also , i what to know how long it will take .
do you have the package with you ? i would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
do you insure package ?
yes . all you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
is there a way that i can be sure that the people in south america receive my package ?
the post office rarely loses package . you can , however , request a rectum receipt .
one last question-what are your hours ?
we open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
hello , thank you for taking the time to interview me .
hi there , i ’ m bill gotcha , the owner of gotcha enterprises . did you find your way here ok ?
your assistant gave wonderful directions .
why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
our company is moving overseas and i wish to stay in the united states .
what are you best at ?
i am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
what is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
i don ’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
good morning . src international . how may i help you ?
good morning . i 'd like to speak to peter . chen please .
certainly . who should i say is calling ?
this is tim . hunter from hunter industries .
and what is it regarding please ?
we have an appointment for this afternoon . mr . chen will know why i 'm calling .
right , let me run through your options . you can go ahead and cash your undue large-amount deposit certificate if you really want to , but i 'd recommend a personal durable commodities loan .
ok , what does that entail ?
it 's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . if you can hold on to it , it 'll be much better for your finances .
yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . i 'll probably need about 25,000 rib . will that be a problem ?
not at all , mr zu . as the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
i 'm glad you thought of this . i 'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! and i suppose i can use the money from the certificate to pay back this personal durable commodities loan and i wo n't lose any interest , right ?
exactly right . if you 'd like to go ahead , i can process that for you now , mr zu .
my aunt told me one of her secrets -- cellophane tape .
i just got it at the special health store . it 's for my flabby arms .
let me know how it works .
i have to say , i have had enough of this roller coaster .
i know what you mean . i 'm like a yo-yo .
may i have a menu , please ?
of course .
could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
lobster ? it is steamed and served with our special sauce .
is it good ?
sure . it is a most popular dish .
can ’ t you come in and have tea now , peter ?
not yet , i must water the garden first .
do you have to water it now ?
i ’ m afraid i must . look at it ! it ’ s terribly dry .
what a nuisance !
last summer it was very dry , too . don ’ t you remember ? i had to water it every day .
well , i ’ ll have tea by myself . that was quick ! have you finished already ?
yes , look out of the window .
it ’ s raining . that means you needn ’ t water the garden .
i 'm broke , and i have to catch another bus .
why do n't you have any money for another bus ?
i got hungry and bought some chips .
that was smart .
anyway , do you have any change i can use for the bus ?
i do n't have any .
i do n't know how i 'm going to get home .
get a transfer from the bus driver .
how much is a transfer ?
it does n't cost anything .
that 's great ! thanks for your help .
welcome on board . may i see your boarding pass ?

yes , there are so many near our hotei.three blocks away from here , there is temple . it 's famous for its building and paintings.lt ' s worth visiting .

right . i 'd like to deposit 2,000 rib into my current account .
no problem . could i have the cash and your bank book , please ? oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ...
what ? what 's wrong ?
i 'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . look at this watermark , do you see it ?
hello , sir . is there anything i can help you find ?
um ... uh ... i 'm just looking , thanks .

i advise you to read playboy.you can get a lot from it .
but there 's quite a lot of rumors about it .
have you brought the receipt with you ?
no , i do n't . i left it home .
sorry , but we ca n't do anything without the receipt . come back with it .
i did n't know . i 'll go to get it . how late will you be open ?
i have n't told you what happened yet , have i ?
i have n't heard anything .

my mother can make some chinese food .
ok . come back into the classroom , class .

yes , but to the heath , this break has last long enough .
oh , breaktime flies .
come on , baby . it ’ s time now .
mam , another minute , could i ?
what 's the matter , sir ? you look pale .
i feel dizzy and weak . and i 'm having this pain in my ear . i think i am sick .
are you often traveling by plane ?
no , this is the second time .
that 's right . it 's normal if you do n't often take the plane . just relax a little bit .
why this happens to me when i am on the plane ? i feel bad .
do n't worry , sir . it 's just because of the lower pressure .
what should i do about it ?
you may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .
ok , thanks . does it work really ? i 'll give a try .
are you feeling better now ? do you need some pills ?
much better . thank you . i just feel tired but i ca n't fall asleep .
so , you 'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well .
i am not used to wearing that . thanks .
if you try to adapt yourself to your destination 's local time , you 'll feel more comfortable . so please try to sleep , and have meals according to los angeles 's time .
could i see the manager please ? i have a complaint to make .
yes , i ’ m the manager here . what can i do for you , madam ?
did you have the room checked before we move in ?
which room are you in ?

i would like to open an account please .

oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license .
ok , just fill in this application . you can sit over there . this brochure explains our services . we have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on atm card . there is no service
hello , how can i be of service ?
hello . i 'm not sure who i need to speak to . i got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .
the first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ; d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? then we check the watermark . in my opinion it is counterfeit . i 'll just run it through the scanner to double check .
what happens now ?
what do you reading , linda ?
i 'm reading a novel , the mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias .
what 's it about ?
it 's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . it describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha
is it difficult to understand ?
not really , i would consider it easy .
besides novels , any other types literary works that you indulgence .
i really like short stories .
have you read anything else besides literature ?

excuse me , i need to get to cambridge today .
would you like to go by train or by bus ?
i am not sure , which one is better ?
the bus is cheaper but also slower . it will take about two-and-a-half hours .
and how long does the train take ?
if you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes .
where do i catch the train ?
the trains for cambridge leave from king 's cross station . they run approximately every half hour . most trains to cambridge go from platform 9 .
how do i get to king 's cross ?
the best way is to take an underground tube train directly to king 's cross . the underground station is just round the corner from here .
can you show me on the map ?
it is very easy . just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . the entrance to the underground station is about 50 meters further on .
thank you very much .

would you mind if i ask some personal questions ?
no . i don ’ t . please .

the consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . we have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality i am afraid .
is there anything wrong ?
we bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .
it 's hard for us to believe it . our instruments have been the best quality for years . have you any reliable evidence ?
here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in london . you may inspect the defective instruments personally
well . according to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . we ’ ll send our technicians to repair them .
forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . you should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
i am sorry about the quality problem , but i propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
i do n't think you 've met my sister , mary .
no , i have n't had the pleasure .
come and meet her now .
excuse me , would you tell me how to return to hilton hotel . i 'm afraid i lost my way .
did you have hotel card or something ?
let me see . yes , i have the address and hotel telephone number here .
oh , you stay at the down town hilton . when you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .
the bathroom looks lovely . did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
i did it myself . i went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . then i went to diy shop and bought everything i needed . i ’ m sure i saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . i learnt a lot by doing it myself .
so , let ’ s see . you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . you ’ ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . the bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?
yes , they are . i gave them a good clean . they are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .
how long did it take you to do the tiling .
as i hadn ’ t done it before , i had to keep referring to income 3ation i got from the internet . doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . then i spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
i think you ’ ve done a very good job . as least as good as a professional would do . perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
i 'd like to see that pen , please .
you mean this one ?
no , the other one in the brown case .
oh , this one ... here .
may i try it ?
sure .
it 's very smooth . i 'll take it .
cash or charge ?
i ’ ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .
we have the offer ready for you . let me see ... here it is . 100 cases houston bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , c . i . f european main ports , for shipment in june 2001 . the offer is valid for five days .
why , your price has soared . it ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . it would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
i ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . you know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . the price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
i ’ m afraid i can ’ t agree with you there . i must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ ve received from other sources .
but you must take the quality into consideration . everyone in the trade knows that us ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
i agree that yours are of better quality . but there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . you can ’ t very well ignore that . prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .
there ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . that ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . to be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
good morning.sir.my name is liu peng from tsinghai university . i am here for the interview relating to my visa application .

yes , i went to cambridge . after graduation , i started right away into the advertising industry . later , i made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research .
so , what experience do you have ?
i have ten years marketing experience . this includes both entry level and management positions . in my last position , i worked my way up to being director of the marking department .
i can see that from your resume.your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
i felt after five years in one place , i was ready for something new . i would like to have a job that is challenging , something that i can see and do new things every day . i loved many things about my former job , and i left with amiable feelings on both sides . i was just ready for something new .
i see . do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
i would rather work full-time .
i 'll make note of that . now , what are your salary expectations ?
my lease ends next month , so i have to find a new place .
i feel sorry for you . it 's a jungle out there .
do you know any places ?
well . i guess i can ask around to see if anyone 's got a room or apartment available .
thank you . i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone 's got a sublet .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
i can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
looks like you 'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
it does n't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
anything you need to have in the place ?
i want a bedroom with full bath , and it 'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
you can also check out university bulletin boards .
why ? will those be students who are leaving ?
not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
thank you . i 'll be sure to take a look .
excuse me , but can i draw on my account for payment of things i buy in china ?
certainly , sir . how much do you draw ?
rib 8,000 , please . would you please tell me my balance ?

your honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding .
you must 've been speeding .
no , your honor , i was not .
tell me how many miles per hour you were going .
i was going 35 in a 40 mph zone .
that 's fine , so i 'll let you go with a warning .
so , i do n't have to pay the ticket ?
you wo n't have to pay the fine .
yes ! i finally lost that last five pounds i 've been working on forever !
how did you finally do it ?
a friend suggested that i stop nibbling between meals .
like snacking ?
you know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...
i get what you mean .
instead , i sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .

mrs . phoebe , here are your ordered goods . please inspect the goods now .
all right . let me have a check . can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ?
our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . it is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . it is the basement for the future cooperation .
that is good . and here i give you a piece of advice . you should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . besides , it 's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . what 's more , the order number was n't anywhere on some of the boxes .
i realize that now . i will do that after a while .
thank you . can i open the packages to check the color and style ?
of course , let me help you .
the color and style are consistent with the sample . great !
you know , we are superior to other clothes companies .
yes , that 's for sure . there is nothing wrong with the quality . i think you 'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons .

just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you do n't lose your temper .
i think that 's a bad idea . i 'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
hey , you look great ! how 's everything ?
yeah , you know what ? i 've been going to the club regularly . the training really pays off . now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit .
really ? tell me about it . i have n't gone to the club for a long time . i am too busy with work .
it 's important to do proper exercises .
you 're right . too much or too little wo n't do any good .
the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
sounds reasonable .
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
and fruits !
surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
i 've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can help one to keep sound physical health .
i think if you follow your trainer 's advice , you 'll be on the right track .
staying out all night , you frightened me to death .
i stayed with my friends .
you should at least give me a call .
did anyone call ?
just mr . white .
what did he want ?
what kind of job do you intend to do ?
i want to do some management job since i have three-year 's work history .
what are your plans if you were hired ?
you stepped on my foot !
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?
while i think it 's great that they 're trying to get people to quit smoking , but i do n't really care for the advertisement .
why not ?
the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
it 's a pun . they use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
i know , but i think it 's not really appropriate for young children .
i think they 're trying to scare the young people so that they do n't ever start smoking .
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
perhaps you 're right , , though . maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
i have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but i do n't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
that 's a good point . i think i was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that i did n't think about how children might understand the ad .
good morning . could i speak with mr . willard please ?
this is he . who ’ s calling , please ?
this is chris emerson speaking .
can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , miss thong ?
certainly . a letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . a memorandum is a communication within an organization .
should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?
no , not necessary . usually we have a set form which is printed . we just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .
lily , i am terribly sorry about this . but we have to put off or cancel tomorrow 's meeting .
cancelled ? that 's just ca n't happen !
sorry to say , but nothing can be done . the equipment broke down and ca n't be fixed till friday .
overseas operator , may i help you ?
yes . i would like to place a collect call .
can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?
terry and his number is 4562325 8 .
would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ?
i would be happy to help . what would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
i would like to help you with both .
that will work out fine . to make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
a dressy party would be fun !
that will work out fine . do you think that chinese or continental food would be best ?
we should probably have both .
yes , that will work out fine . should we hire a band or bring in a dj ?
maybe we could do both !
i ca n't find the price tag .
it 's right here . $ 100 .
but i heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .
ours are of really good quality .
peter , how often do you exercise ?
well , i swim and run every day .
now , tell me , what do you eat ?
well , i do n't eat any meat , but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
where can i call a taxi ?
how did your company 's fundraiser go ?
the fundraiser events went really well . we were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the american cancer society . all of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .
so how does it work ? how were you able to make money with the marathon ?
each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . all in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .
sounds like a great deal for the american cancer society .
how may i help you today ?
i need to open a second account .
what kind of account would you like to open ?
i need another savings account .
do you have another account with us ?
i sure do .
would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
that ’ s fine .
how much would you like to transfer ?
transfer $ 100 .
give me a moment while i complete your transaction .
how about your grades of study ?
i have been doing quite well . as reach 90 % and bs reach 100 % . and i ’ ve received scholarship two times .
besides your major , do you know some in other fields ?
yes . to develop my knowledge , i studied economics , business administration and accountingthrough self-study . nowadays , i have passed three courses on cpa .
have you ever been a student cadre ?
yes . i used to be the monitor of my class .
did it affect you much ?
it ’ s a very important experience for me . first , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who i like or dislike .
in your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?
what kind of a car do you have ?
an old one .
i know it 's old , but what make is it ?
it 's a chevrolet . why do you ask ? you going into the car business ?
nothing like that . my cousin is going to take a job overseas and he ca n't take his car with him , so he 's going to sell it - cheap . it 's practically new .
well i have been thinking about getting a newer car . i ca n't afford a brand new one .
would you like to look at my cousin 's car ?
is it a four-door or a two-door ?
it 's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
does it have automatic transmission ? .
yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
what is my prime responsibility in daily work ?
your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want .
what other things do i need to know ?
you 'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . you may be bored with a job like that .
how about your interview ?
they turned me down .
why ? you are so excellent .
i think the only reason is that i was too nervous during the interview and i could n't express myself the way i wanted to .
what a shame ! you should have showed yourself to them !
it does n't matter . i 'll try other companies .
i suggest you hunt for a job on the internet .
on the internet ? i 've never heard of it .
it 's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
is that safe ?
of course , if you log on some standard websites .
we are here .
ok . how much is the fare ?
the total is 45 yuan .
45 yuan ? it is too much , are you sure ?
it is 45 yuan on the meter .
is there something wrong with your meter ?
no . i am sure about that .
ok . could you give me a receipt ?
excuse me . would you mind trading seats with me ?
not at all .
oh , thank you . that ’ s very kind of you .
you ’ re welcome . i prefer a window seat .
do you plan to further your study ?
yes , i have been always learning the economics on my own . my dream is to get a master 's degree in economics .
if you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . the tuition fee will be financed by our company .

what 's it look like , lady ? this is the ticket line i 'm standing in , is n't it ?
well , yes , it is , but ...
so , what 's your beef anyway , lady ?
you just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that 's what ! go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !
oh sure , lady , and fat chance i 'd get a ticket before they 're sold out . i 'm staying right here , understand ? so be a nice lady and butt out !

because i 'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . it 's as simple as that , lady .

whew ! i got the last one . this must be my lucky day !
what was that you just said ? last one ... ? hey , they 've closed the ticket window !
yes , i 'm afraid i bought the last ticket , and to think , if you had n't been such a gentleman . . .

i like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .
which tests do you mean ?

good morning , mr zhang , i wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior .
yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .
what 's the answer ?
we decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
let me see . i quoted your delivery in three months , did n't i ?
yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
i thought you would be worried about it . so i rang auckland last night . as you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave auckland next month .
good , if you agree we 'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
be careful . the floor is wet .
what happened ?
hello , this is lucie jing calling from lincoln bank . may i speak to mr was , please ?
speaking .
ah , hello , mr was . i 'm just calling about your new credit card . it has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you .
sending it wo n't be necessary . i 'm actually coming in for a meeting with my personal banker this afternoon .
what perfect timing !
indeed . is there anything i need to do before i collect it ?
not really . but we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you are n't happy with .
i 'm sure it 'll be fine . how about my pin number ?
that will be sent on to you within 2 working days . then , you can start using your new card .
what are we eating for lunch ?
i have no idea . what about you ?
i kind of want pizza .
i ate pizza the other day .
so , what do you feel like eating then ?
how about some burgers ?
i already had a burger yesterday .
what are we going to do ?
we can just each get what we want to get .
that sounds like a plan .
do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
did you bring your certificate for nursing ?
yes , here is my certificate of nurse .
how about your nursing education ?
i learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at hunan nursing school .
can you manage english conversation ?
have you ever thought about having children , kaitlyn ?
my husband and i have thought about it , but we 've decided not to have any . they 're just too expensive . besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of worl
well , i 've always wanted to have lots of children . growing up with only one brother , i always felt a bit lonely . what do you think about families with only one child ?
for me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i would n't ever have to share .
do n't you think you would miss having other people around ?
no way ! i spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , i do n't think i 've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . what do you think fo the one-child policy
if china did n't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ?
that 's true . but as a woman , i 'm glad that even though i do n't want any children , i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand , i ca n't imagine what china would be like
do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
is tom in ?
no , he is at work now .
may i have his office phone number please ?
what about driving to shanghai ?
driving ? no way , it 's too far .
i just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . how long will it take ?
too long , and you do not have much time .
good afternoon . i 'll show you to your room .
thank you .
could you tell me which bags are yours ?
they 're over there next to the door . those three with green tags on them .
could you wait a moment ? i have to get a trolley . may i see your room key , please ?
sure , here it is .
excuse me , sir . is there anything i can do for you ?
yes . i bought the can two days ago , but today i found that is beyond the guarantee period .
excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . the station is at the end of that street .
how long will it take me to get there ?
it 's about a ten-minute walk .
that 's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
excuse me ! does this bus go to the railway station ?
no , you 're got on the wrong bus . you can take a no . 22 bus at the university station and then transfer to a no . 83 bus at the railway station .
i have here our price sheet on a f . o . b . basis . the prices are given without engagement .
good , if you ’ ll excuse me , i ’ ll go over the sheet right now .
take your time .
i can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .
i ’ m surprised to hear you say so . you know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .
we only ask that your prices be comparable to others . that ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?
well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . but first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
the size of our order depends greatly on the prices . let ’ s settle that matter first .
well , as i ’ ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
when i say your prices are much too high , i don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .
how much do you mean then ? can you give me a rough idea ?
to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .
impossible . how can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
i think you are as well - informed as i am about the market for chemical fertilizers . it ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . may i suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?
excuse me , you look lost.can i help you ?
oh , thank you . i 'm looking for the train station .
right . let me see . you go straight down here and turn right .
right ? ok , got it .
then take the next left then the next right . are you with me ?
i 'm sorry , but i did n't catch what you said .
i said , ' do you want me to help you ? '
i 'm trying to find a post office .
go three blocks and turn right . it 's right there .
should i take the bus ?
no . it 'll only take about five minutes to walk .
thank you very much .
it says here that you graduated from beijing normal university with a major in english language and literature .
right . then you may think that i am not fit for this job according to my educational background .
yes .
but i want to be a tour guide very much because i like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . so i took an evening course at the tourism school of beijing after graduation and i have gotten a qualification certificate .
so you must be an extravert ?
yes , i always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
what do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
a tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
do n't you consider it a hard work ?
hard but interesting , i think .
have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
yes , i usually guided foreign tourists around beijing when i was in university .
have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than english ?
didn ’ t you punch in this morning , monica ?
sorry , i don ’ t know the rule about punching .

according to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .
how about the lunch break , lucy ?
from 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock .
may i ask whether we need to work overtime ?
this needs dry-cleaning.can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ?
let me see . we ’ ll try , but i ’ m not sure that we can remove it .
ok , then . we ’ ll i ’ d also like to have this pressed .
any starch ?
what 's the problem ?
i have a laceration on my left forearm .
let me have a look . how did this happen ?
i got hit by a car in an accident .
was there much bleeding afterward ?
no , not much .
well , this does n't look too serious . nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?
will i need stitches ?
yes . three , i think . it wont ' be too painful . alright , we 're done . that was n't so bad , was it ?
no , not really .
you 're lucky there was no lasting damage . i 'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . we 'll take those stitches out then . so long .
what time is it ?
ten to nine .
your watch is ten minutes slow . so it 's should be nine sharp . i 'm gon na be late again . what will be my excuse this time ? it should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
do n't cry over spilled milk , fred ? could you stay with me a few minutes ?
what ? why ? what 's wrong with you ?
i just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.it ' s so lonely and boring . my sickness makes it worse . when will i recover ?
you will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . i 've got to woke now , i 'll be late .
you only care about your work .
sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all i do just for our family .
stay just a few minutes longer , ok ?
ok , i 'll leave at 9:15 , is that all right ?
yes .
i 'll spent more time with you in the future , dina .

yes , that 's right .

three or four days , perhaps longer .
how is the result of your lab test ?
when it comes to that , i have a lot to say .
then say it .
when i went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , i tried to keep a poker face even though i was scared to death . then you guess what he said .
that ’ s just what i want to know .
could you tell me something about your family ?
ok . there are five people in my family , father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and i .
are your brother and sister still in school ?
my brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .
what does your father do ?
my father is a middle school teacher .
what about your mother ?
my mother is a housewife .
are you married ?
i am not married yet and i live alone now .
do you need to support your family ?
no , my father and brother are doing that .
have you finished school ?
i 'm in heaven ! a whirlpool dryer !
i love them , too . let 's move into the kitchen . wait until you see the refrigerator .
this is too good to be true .
and the stove is brand new . you know how to use a gas stove , right ?
yes . we 've lived in taiwan for a while . i had a gas stove in the states , too .
it 's better for cooking chinese food . well , what do you think ?
how 's your new car ?
perfect ! could n't be better .
you made a good choice , then ?
it 's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i am glad you are happy .
good afternoon , sir . you 're here to see about a temporary loan , right ? the loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . is that what you require ?
yes , that 's exactly what i need . how about terms for these ?
well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . the balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
is there any flexibility on that ?
unfortunately , not .
ok . in my position , i think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . that would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
mr . wang , i 've had scheduled for your two days stay in shanghai . you can make some changes if it does not suit you .
all right . please read it to me .
on friday morning , mr . wang , the director of shanghai research institute , will visit you at the hotel . in the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with mr . yang , vice manager of computer corporation .

hi , i would like to return this tv .
sure , do you have the receipt ?
yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard .
ok . may i ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
the tv flickers a lot when i am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
i see , and what about the keyboard ?
i spilled some coffee on it and now it wo n't work .
i am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we can not take responsibility for misuse or damages .

sure , for at least three thousand per month .
that 'll bring the price down to twenty-five . that 's the price we were shooting for .

it seems that many boys are fighting there .
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! the pollution levels were so high that we were n't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
as much as i love this city , i think i 'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . living in a polluted city like this just ca n't be good for my health .
i know what you mean . however , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . if it 's not the pollution , then it 's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
it 's the gradual rise in the earth 's temperature .
i see , so it 's similar to global warming ?
they 're related to one another , yes .
i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it 's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it 's not all good news . they 've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .

i know that tea . it smells fragrant .

some of them , i think , are not good .
it does n't taste good ?
no , i mean some of them are not clean enough .
that 's my greatest concern . but how can you tell which one is clean ?

thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ?
no , just occasionally

yes , it sounds like everything i expected .
sandy , can you help me contact these people ?
sure , what do you want me to tell them ?
well , i need to confirm the time of their classes .
ok , where can i find their telephone number ?
they are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers .
alright . what if i can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ?
then , you should e-mail them with the information .
where can i find their e-mail addresses ?
they should have then listed on their resumes .
and if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ?
then send them a sms on their cell phone .
ok . that sounds easy enough . have you called any of them yet ?
yes . i called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up .
did you leave a voice message ?
i left a voice message on one -- -just for the first person on the list .
i see . what did you tell her ?
i told her that she should call me back at my office number .
ok , so , maybe i should call her again .
yes , that sounds like a good idea . she might not get the other message in time .
one more question . it looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . do you have a calling card that i can use to get through to them ?
sure . you can use this one . the pin number is written on the back of the card .
alright . thanks a lot . don ’ t worry . i ’ ll take care of it .

here we go . there is a museum of the beijing opera art .
wow . look at this . so delicate and beautiful . did ancient chinese people really wear them ?
not really . they are just opera costumes . do you like the embroidery ?
i surely do . they must have had advanced machine in ancient china to do that .
no , no , no . they are all handmade , girl . you know , the ancient chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
good morning . can i see mr jackson , please ?
well . have you got his permission ?
yes . we have an appointment at eight o ’ clock .
what ’ s your name , please ?
the environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions .
yes . this gap can be filled by export market research before exporting .
but the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
that 's right . they do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .
therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
hello , i really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position .
i was wondering if you like team projects , or projects that you work on alone .
i like to work on group projects that value and need each individual ’ s contributions .
are you most interested in a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to quickly advance ?
i have children so a steady job is important but i would like a chance to advance .
how would you feel about relocating to another state ?
i could not relocate in the next year , but might be open to it in the future .
do you know how much this job offers per year ?
a minimum of 75,000 per year .
hello , could i speak to allison , please ?
i 'm sorry , he 's out at the moment .
when do you expect him back ?
i think he 'll be back in about an hour at least .
well , may i leave a message ?
yes , of course .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
ok . does he know your number ?
i 'm afraid he does n't . my mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
i am sorry . i didn ’ t accomplish the job on time .
waiter !
yes , can i help you ?
where shall i pay the bill ?
you can pay here .
ok . how much is it all together ?
it is one hundred and fifty . this is your bill .
is the service charge included ?
yes .
ok , here you are .
good afternoon , madam . is there anything i can do for you ?
yes , i spent so much time sightseeing here . it is already so late now . i am afraid i ca n't catch the last bus back to downtown .
do n't worry . i will try to get a taxi for you . you can take it to the bus station .
i am very grateful to your help .
do n't mention it . it is my duty .
looks like dinner 's ready .
i 'm done . can i watch tv ?
here 's some water . take these multi-vitamins and tylenol .
uh ! i ca n't swallow them , mom !
your throat must be swollen .
do i have to take them ?
here , i 'll break them up , so they 're smaller . and here 's some cough syrup .
yuck !
hello , mary .
oh , hello , tom ! beautiful day , isn ’ t it ?
excuse me , is this the auto consumer loan center ?
yes . is there anything i can do for you ?
could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ?
the deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the pbc .
i plan to take the loan for 3 years .
well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . i 'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .
what about the loan repayment ?
you may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .
does that mean i should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?
exactly . you are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .
that 's very thoughtful of you . thank you so much .
you really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment .
that apartment never had any problems before . are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ?
we spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .
where do you think you have problems ?
there is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
you know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
you are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
i will fix these problems when i get around to it .
i will be withholding my rent check this friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
taxi !
yes , sir . where to ?
wangfujing , please !

it begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
thank you so much . i 'll try and catch that .
the radio has brought us lots of convenience .
yes , i can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
with the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
i ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but i ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . could you give me some advice ?
certainly ! the first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . dogs are very demanding . you need to take them for walks and they love to play . cats , on the other hand , are more independent .
i ’ m fairly busy , so i really need an animal that i don ’ t need to care of very much . actually , i ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . i do n't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . do you have any suggestions ?
unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . is that a problem ?
not really . by the way , i don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .
we have those , but i only sell them to people i know well , for obvious reasons . how about a lizard ? i have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .
that sounds ideal . could you show me some ?
sure . come over here . as you can see , i have a wide selection of species . they can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . do you have a favourite colour ?
i like the red one . what do they eat ?
you can feed them on various things . they will eat small pieces of meat , but i ’ d recommend insects . you can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . i sell them here .
thanks a lot . what i ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .
i 'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order .
may i have your flight number , please ?
world airlines , flight 201 .
and your name , please ?
john anderson .
yes , sir . you 're booked on flight 201 , leaving in one hour .
i really think if i can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . do you think you can help me polish my interview style ?
sure . doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off .
i ’ ve researched the company and think i ’ m perfect for the job but i ’ m not sure how to get it across to them .
well first you have to have more confidence.employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves .
i know i have what it takes but im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . should i inflate my experience ?
after i am accepted for unemployment benefits , what will happen next ?
you will receive a notice of unemployment insurance award letter .
what will that tell me ?
the award letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly .
are there any other forms that i need to fill out ?
you will need to fill out a continued claim form every two weeks .
what information will i need to provide on that form ?
they will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
are there any other questions on the form ?
hello , i was wondering if i could talk with the apartment manager .

i 'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to australia . can you do that ?
well , i have n't made such arrangements with the factory yet . so i 'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you .
all right , but i 'm busy . how long will it be before you can finish the talk ?
i wo n't be too long , i suppose . just let me ring them , will you ?

my boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . i suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ?
there ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . do you work in a cubicle ?
yes , i do . i don ’ t like it very much .

yes , i will graduate from the people 's university of china this july majoring in international trade.besides , at school , i am a top student.moreover , both my spoken and written english are pretty good .
well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year .
i think i ' m qualified for the job if i can be given the chance.while at school , i once worked as part-time translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years.and i do n't mind being paid less from the start , i just want to enrich my experience and competence .

how do you like your overcoat , sir ?
it 's a bit too large . would you please shorten the sleeves ?

we have a flight that we 'll put you there at ten am.is that ok ?
nothing earlier ? i prefer flight at nine thirty .
i 'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
no , exactly not
how about afternoon ?
we have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . now i am calling to talk about the terms of payment . what are your terms of payment ?
well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l \ c , payable against shipping documents .
i see . payment by lc is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept da or dp ?
i 'm afraid not . that is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way .
what about the cost of delivery ?
what may i help you with ?
i need to file a complaint .
what is your complaint about ?
i got robbed .
when did this happen ?
it happened this morning .
what was taken ?
my wallet and cell phone .
did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ?
i sure did .
would you able to pick him out of a line-up ?
dad , i ’ d like to borrow some money .
sure , johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
come on , dad , i need thirty thousand . i wan na get into the market . you know , i ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . i look at this as an opportunity . this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
i don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there ’ s just too much instability . i wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
but look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.and anyway , i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . there are emerging markets that promise great returns . look at china , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
smells good ! what ’ s for breakfast ?
well , since we are getting up so late , i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of , so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah , just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
come on , fellows . let 's enjoy my wife 's cooking !
em , it 's delicious !
thank you ! my wife likes cooking very much .
our advertisement says english competence is a key requirement of this position . then how do you think of your proficiency in written and spoken english ?
i have learned english for 10 years , and i have passed college english test band 4 and 6.my spoken english is fairly good enough to express myself fluently .
what other foreign language do you speak ?
why did you apply for the position ?
i learned from your ad.that you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.this is just what i need , because i 'm a recent college graduate . i have the necessary knowledge and skills but i lack experience .
what do you hope to become ?
i want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future i would be promoted to a higher position .
linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ?
no , do n't try to tempt me . i 'm becoming chubby , and i have to slim down .
you are not really chubby . you are actually thin enough .
i do n't think so . i know i 've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight , are n't you ?
how about your grades of study ?
i had been doing quite well . in all subjects , i got excellent scores .
well . in that case , you must have got good records in english , too .
yes , i was the top student among my classmates .
how about your oral english ?
excuse me , i 'd like to have these pants i bought here yesterday altered . here 's my receipt .
certainly , sir . what would you like done to them ?
they 're a little bit too long , so i 'd like about half an inch taken off them .
all right , sir . they should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .
thank you very much .

it 's my pleasure .
i wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter .
is she acting up in class ?
not at all . she 's a joy to have in my class .
is she really ?
she is absolutely wonderful .
so she is n't causing you any problems ?
no . she is actually very intelligent and well behaved .
i 'm glad to know that you like her .
good afternoon , ladies . may i help you ?
can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ?
have you made a reservation , ladies ?
i 'm afraid not .
one moment , please . i have to check if there are rooms available . i 'm sorry , ladies . we have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . would you mind that ?
we prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night .
then may i suggest a family suite ? we have just had a cancellation .
what is it like ?
it 's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds . we could also add rollaways .
that 's great ! how much is it ?
two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax .
that 's fine .
but ladies , the room is not yet ready . there will be a delay of about half an hour . perhaps you could fill in the registration form first , and then rest in our lobby for a while . we will let you know when the room is ready .
alright , hanks .
ladies , hotel policy requires one night 's room charge as deposit .

great . then i 'll be at your hotel at two .
all right .
how could i get there ?
the hotel is near to people 's square . its name is bai ju hotel .
what 's your room number ?
it 's room 302 on the third floor . but i 'll be waiting for you in the lobby , if you ca n't find me , please page me .

in that case , our offer for the white-collar series is us $ 200 , and the other is us $ 300 per set .

um , ninety-five dollars ?
yes , that ’ s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why , how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at helen ’ s boutique . i didn ’ t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .

just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . and you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .
good morning , i made an appointment with dr . smith , but i have to change it .
when you made your appointment , what day did you choose ?
my appointment was on wednesday .
at what time was that appointment ?
it was for 4
i can see the appointment that you had . what day do you need to change to ?
i want to change to next tuesday .
what time would you prefer ?
i would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon .
can i help you ?
en , i am looking for a porter , do you know where i can find one ?
there are so many here.the men with red hats are the porters .
what 's the charge ?
well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
it 's a difficult choice.the train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
we could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
buses are more cramps and you ca n't walk around .
that 's true.but i feel that i see more when i travel by bus .
really ? i think you see more traveling by train .
so which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
ok , then we 'll go by train . i 'm sure we 'll have a good journey.shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
the trains are n't usually full.we can get them on the day we travel.we should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
did you hear about lulu ?
no , what ?
she and vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer .
get out of here ! i didn ’ t even know they were dating !
here 's a model of our latest design . what do you think of it ?
well , i 'm not too happy about it .
what 's wrong with it ?
well , i 'm afraid it 's not at all what i wanted . you have n't really followed my instructions.it ' ll have to be done again .
hello , this is the international youth hotel . how can i help you ?
oh , yes . i want to check whether you still have any vacancies . i need three single rooms for next monday .
ok . there 're vacancies . since the peak season is coming , it 's advisable to book soon . would you like to make a reservation now ?
yes , please . do you take credit cards ?
yes , we accept all major credit cards .
and how about internet access ?
there 's free internet access in the lobby .
is it available in the rooms ?
unfortunately not .
that 's ok . is breakfast included ?
yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
fantastic . thank you very much .
what sort of shopping is nearby , mr . taylor ?
call me john . this is a great area of the city for shopping . there ’ s a grocery store just around the corner .
what about things other than food ?
well , the riverside mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .
are there small shops near here as well ?
yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .
well , that sounds just wonderful .
now darling , i know that we 've bought this house together , but it 's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . i think we should sell it .
oh , no , nathan , i ... i really think we 've bought this flat at the right time , you know.market prices are going to go up , and i think you 'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
but we 're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . i think we could get a much cheaper place that 's already furnished .
but do n't you like this place ? i remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
well , only you liked it really , darling .
hi , bob , everything okay ?
more or less . there 's just one thing bothering me .
oh ? what 's that ?
well , you know i have some students studying for their master 's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
what gift ?
it 's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was , i was really uncomfortable . i mean it 's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i do n't think i 've done anything to deserve that gift , so i refused it .
you refused the gift ? that 's terrible .
i know , but i really ca n't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
i 've been looking for a swimming pool , but i have n't found one yet .
we have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
swim stations ? could you be a little more explicit ?
you know how you run on a treadmill but do n't go anywhere ? well , it 's the same thing .
gee , that 's a great idea . now , how much do i have to pay ?
the stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
great ! now , when can i go down there and use the stations ?
the swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
boy , oh boy ! i ca n't wait to change into my swim trunks .
hi . today , i am the interviewer for your visa application .
ok . here is my application form and all the documents .
can you tell me why do you want a visa to america ?
because i want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world .
ok . do you plan to go to america all by yourself or with your family ?
myself .
have you finished all you preparation ?
what a pity you are leaving so soon . i wish you could stay a few more days . sir , can you deliver a speech for us ?
dear friends . here , i wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . actually i did n't expect at all for this . i owe a lot to all of you here . it 's been 5 days since i came to visit here . time really flies . i feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . i will miss you while i am leaving . let 's keep in touch in any way . what 's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up !
cheers ! and we are honored to have such an honored guest today . mr . james , i hope we will meet somewhere in the near future .
madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . i hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . in this way , we will know each other better .
i have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you .
i have time to speak with you . where would you like to purchase your house ?
i am most interested in pasadena or arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions .
how many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
we have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
it doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children .
is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
in a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
waiter .
would you like anything else ?
no , thanks . please bring us the bill .
all right . and do you want to separate bills or just one single bill ?
separate bills , please .
here is your bill . it comes to 80 yuan . and yours is 60 yuan .
if this coat does n't fit , may i bring it back later ?
what are the attractions of that city ?
it 's famous for beautiful countryside with clean air .
oh , that 's what i am looking for . do you have a reduction for 6 persons ?
i would like to order a waistcoat .
have you chosen the material ?
yes , i want it to made of tweed .
fine . and the charge is $ 100 .

hi , i 'm george . i 'll be your waiter this evening . are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ?
i 'm ready now . i 'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
and would you like an appetizer before your meal ? the soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
i 'll pass on the soup , but i 'd like a garden salad .
can i get you anything to drink ?
yes , i 'd like a glass of iced tea .
okay . i 'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
what is your salary at present ?
my present pay is 100,000 yuan per year .
what are your salary expectations now ?
i like to be paid more than that . hopefully , 120,000 yuan per year .
that 's a little more than we had planned .
i think you 'll find i 'm worth that .
i can only offer you 110,000 yuan a year . raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . is that satisfactory ?
excuse me . i 've been waiting for my main dish for quite a time .
yes , sir.just a minute , please , i 'll check with the kitchen .
thank you for waiting.it takes another ten to fifteen minutes , i 'm afraid .
we have an appointment in half an hour .
i see .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
well , yes.how about beef stew ? we can serve you at once .
hi , sally ! you are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl !
congratulations , bob ! that ’ s great news , what ’ s her name ?
we ’ ve named her alice after my wife ’ s grandmother .
excuse me , can you tell me where is the taxi stand ?
you can find one at the end of the street .
are there any signs there ?
no.but there are quite many cars .
would dr.black be able to see me at 9:00 a . m . tomorrow ?
i 'm sorry , but she wo n't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there 's a cancellation .
would 1 : oo p . m . be convenient ?
oh ! ! ! i have a horrible toothache .
you should go to the dentist .
i hate dentists .
well , suffer then . if you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
it always hurts . i hate going .
stop being such a baby . if it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
o . k . , o . k . , i ’ ll go .
sally , you look so corporate ! what interview do you have today ?
amalgamated trading company . it 's swiss . do n't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?
yeah , i guess so . i 've never actually heard of this one , but ...
well , it 's small , but it 's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
you did n't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
four times . i 'm totally prepared . oh , no ! i forgot to take off my nail polish ! and i have to be there in 15 minutes ! that 's it . i blew it .
well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they do n't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . just keep your confidence up and you 'll do great .
but the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like i 'm the only one left who has n't found a job .
i 'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet .
i 'm sorry , hold on a moment . i 'll check it out . but we have already shipped it to you last month . would you like us to contact the express company to know what 's going on ?
please find out the reason as soon as possible . we are in bad need of it .
i really want to make something for dinner .
what are you going to cook ?
i have n't the slightest clue what i 'm going to make .
a teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
i do n't know how to make that .
all you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
that sounds fairly simple , but how do i cook it ?
the first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
what 's next ?
then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
what 's the next thing i need to do ?
good morning !
can i speak to miss cooper please ?
would you hold on a second , please ? miss cooper 's extension is engaged .
engaged . oh , dear ! could you tell her it 's a long-distance call ?
i 'm sorry , sir . i ca n't interrupt her . i 'm sure she wo n't be very long .
how long do you think she 'll be ?
i really ca n't say how long she 'll be .
can i leave a message , please ?
yes , certainly .
can you tell her i 'm waiting to speak to her ?
yes , sir . i 'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? a friend of mine will join us .
wait a moment . here you are .
by the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
can you help me out , chuck ?
sure . what 's it , yvonne ?
i want to put my desk over there , but it 's too heavy for me to move .
good morning . madam . what can i do for you today ?
hello . i hope you can help me ; i 'm a little worried about my new card .
what seems to be the problem ?
i received my new card this morning , but i 'm unable to use it .
oh ? you mean , the atm machine has eaten it ?
no , it 's right here , see ? the atm will not accept it !
you said you received your card this morning , am i right ?
yes . i was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . so , what 's gone wrong ?
did you receive your pin number yet , madam ? you see , unless you have your new pin number , to match your new card , you can not use it . we usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
can you manage chopsticks ?
why not ? see .
good mastery . how do you like our chinese food ?
oh , great ! it 's delicious . you see , i am already putting on weight . there is one thing i do n't like however , msg .
what 's wrong with msg ? it helps to bring out the taste of the food .
according to some studies it may cause cancer .
oh , do n't let that worry you . if that were true , china would n't have such a large population .
i just happen to have a question for you guys . why do the chinese cook the vegetables ? you see what i mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
do you have any seat preferences , sir ?
yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?
yes . would you like a window seat ?
morning . rent-a-car agency . may i help you ?
good morning . this is paul alexander calling from the isis advertising firm . we need a car to the airport for mr . phillips .
certainly , mr . alexander . when would mr . phillips like to leave ?
i 'm calling today about a bill that i never received .
can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
it was for my master card .
you should 've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
i have n't got it in the mail yet .
the computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
what am i supposed to do about my bill then ?
maybe you should call your post office .
but if it 's their mistake , can i get an extension on my bill payment ?
yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
okay , thank you very much for your help .
jenny , do n't you think it 's really charming ?
yes . it 's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
let 's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .
ok , allen . it 's your turn . are you ready ?
i really would rather just listen . is n't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
come on ! in the two hours we 've been here you have n't sung even one song !
i know , but ... hey , stanley 's here ! i 've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
well , you asked for it . why do n't you put on an elvis song for him . he loves `` the king . ``
how are you doing , jim ?
fine , just fine.how about you ?
i think your presentation impressed the client , daniel . you did a good job .
what 's for lunch ?
what happened to you ?
i think i caught a cold .
do you have any symptoms ?
runny nose and coughing .
do you have a fever ?
i have just taken the temperature , i do n't think so .
it 's not serious .
are you sure ?
yes .
what should i do ?
what kind of place shall we rent ?
it should be close to the university . neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
absolutely . that 's the most important thing to take into consideration . i 'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we 'll get a bigger one if it 's not expensive . do you mind if it 's in a noisy area .
i do n't mind . i 'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
good point . ok , let 's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
yes , if we 're lucky we 'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
how much do you think the rent will be ?
i do n't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . it 's too soon .
well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of june ?
did you have any working experience during college ?
yes , i did some part-time jobs such as english tutor , salesman , and model .
what did you learn from your part-time jobs ?
smells good ! what ’ s for breakfast ?
well , since we are getting up so late , i decided to make a big breakfast !
nice ! brunch !
kind of , so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah , just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
can you tell me if there is a flight to new york ?
yes . flight db117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in new york at 6:00 am with a layover in chicago . it also makes a refueling stop at colombia .
so many stops ! do n't you have any direct flights ?
hello.hot water overflowed from the bathtub.will you help me ?
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
ok . i will .
i 'll have our housekeeper come right away .
i 'm sorry i was too tired to fall asleep .
when you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
would you like some more coffee ?
no thanks . i 'm full . we need to find our waitress and get our bill .
the waitress is bringing the bill right now .
this waitress has really been on top of things , has n't she ?
yes , this waitress did a great job .
ok , let 's see what the damage is . the total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
what do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . what do you think about 20 % this time ?
yes , 20 % would be perfect .
her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . the total will be $ 43.20 .
yes , that was one fantastic meal !
freeze ! police ! put your hands over your head .
what crime did i commit ?
you are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . we ’ ve found some heroin in your house . you have the following rights while you are being interviewed . you have the right to remain silent . you do n't have to make any statement against your will . you have the right to defense counsel . you have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . do you understand your rights ?
would you like to come by and play bridge ?
well , let 's see . why do n't we go dancing for a change ? we have n't done that for a long time .
well , to tell the truth , i do n't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i 'm sort of tired .
hmm . well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
oh , we always go to the movies . ca n't we do something different ?
well , do you have any suggestions ?
let 's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it 's ok with me , but we do n't have any beer and things .
well , shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over , and i 'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
tom , it 's time for you to go to bed .
good night , mum .
operator . may i help you ?
yes . how do i get an outside line , please ?
just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . or we can place a call for you , if you want .
what 's our target audience for this campaign ?
this go-around we 're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .
do you think that 's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
well , there are some similarities that come up . because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . but that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
right , that makes sense . what 's the average age ?
john , i 'd like to see you in my office for a minute .
yes , sir , i 'll be there in just a moment .
john , i have been watching you . i 've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and i 'm impressed . you 've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . i just want to let you to know , after this month 's performance reviews , i 'm recommending you for promotion .
gosh sir , thank you , sir ! i had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
well , it 's not going to be in our department . i 've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . there 's supervisory spot opening up in financial . i 'm turning your name in for it .
management ? wow , i had no idea i could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
how can i help you today ?
i am returning something that i bought yesterday .
what would you like to return ?
i 'm returning a cellphone .
was there something wrong with it ?
it 's defective .
what is n't working on it ?
it keeps turning off on it 's own .
alright , do you have the receipt ?
i have it right here .
i 'm going to take care of this and refund your money .
i miss grandma . i dreamed about her yesterday .
good morning , sir . can i help you ?
good morning . i 'd like to cash this check .
yes , sir . can you show you identity ?
what about the driving license ?
do n't you have any other identification ?
i am sorry . i only have my driving license with me .
ok . would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?
thank you . here you are .
how do you want your money ?
would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
could you fill in this form , please ?
all right .
have you got any identification ?
hello , arthur . what seems to be the problem ?
hey doc . well , i think i might need glasses . i ’ m getting headaches , and i really struggle to see things that are far away . but i have always had 20/20 vision .
sounds like you may be far-sighted . ok , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
mmm .. . x , e , r , 3 , a question mark , and i can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but i think it ’ s the peace sign .
wow , arthur ! you ’ re as blind as a bat !
yeah , i know , my vision is really blurry at times .
ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while i fill out your prescription .
thanks doc !
would you like some more coffee ?
no thanks . i 'm full . we need to find our waitress and get our bill .
good luck finding the waitress !
the service this evening has kind of sucked . is that our server over there ?
i 'll go get the check , since our server does n't seem to be headed this way .
good . i 'll just stay here until you get back .
so the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .
how much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
i wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
i kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
i think that we should leave 10 % .
i want to fly to congo on monday , the 17th .
let me see what 's available .
by the way , i 'd prefer a night flight .
africa airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .
how much was your watch ?
a guy in my office got the flu the other day . today i seem to have come down with it , too .
very likely . you have a slight fever . do you have a headache , too ?
yes . i wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because i 'll be on a business trip in two days .
well , you have to let your flu run its course . you must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
but i 'm going on a business trip in two days !
would you care for a drink ?
let 's go practice your driving .
if that 's what you want to do , then we can .

here you go .
i 'd like to extend my visa for another two years .
are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?
student visa .
what is the reason for extension ?
i 'll go into a practical training as soon as i receive my master ’ s degree from the university of pennsylvania early next month .
do you like the apartment ?
i absolutely love the apartment .
everything is okay ?
i do have one problem with the apartment .
what ’ s the problem ?
i don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
i did not know that .
i assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .
that was the only thing that i saw wrong with the apartment .
i ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .
come in , arnold . have a seat .
good morning .
would you like something to drink ?
no , thank you . i just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
so , you 're a serious coffee drinker .
yes , it keeps me going . sometimes i think i 'm addicted .
well , coffee is n't such a bad thing.everyone has to have something.for me , it 's cigars . are you a cigar smoker ?
no , i 've tried them . but i 'm not really a smoker .
well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
i wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
i 'm glad when people have new ideas around here . tell me about it .
it is about the staff meetings.you know how we have a staff meeting every tuesday .
yes .
well , i have been thinking about it.and i believe we could do things more efficiently here .
what do you suggest ?
the way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.we meet for one hour . but i think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
you mean because people have to go across town to get here .
yes . some people spend half of the morning on the road .
that 's true . but our staff meetings are very important , arnold . i do n't know how we can function without them .
i think they are important too.that ' s why i want people to have a better attitude about them .
i know a lot of people think the meetings are n't too useful . i 'm aware of that .
here 's what i propose . i think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
well .
i also think the meetings should be more focused.and i would be willing to take responsibility for that .
you mean you want to run the meetings ?
no , not really run them . but i could help organize them . i could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . i could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.this way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
hmm . but we would meet every two weeks .
i really think it would work.the meetings could be longer , and better organized .
i am not against the idea , arnold.it may really be more efficient , as you say . i 'll tell you what we can do.why do n't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
excellent . i would be happy to get started on it .
do you have a good english-chinese dictionary ?
sure . how about this one ?
is this the latest edition ?
yes . we have both the paperback and the hardcover .
what 's the difference ?
the hardcover is more expensive .

i do n't know.the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
i know it is . i do n't know how it happened .
hmm , maybe i do .
what ?

no , i did n't .
when are you going to go get it ?
i 'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .
why did n't you just ask me ?
where should i go ?
you can get one from student services .
i had no clue that i could get it there .
i already knew that .
thanks for letting me know .
you 're welcome .
tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think i should be wearing ?
well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company ’ s dress code .
indeed , i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably , i should put on car key and simple shirt .
excuse me . will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? i just want to make a phone call .
certainly , but will it take long ?
no , i 'll be right back .
mike 's mechanics . can i help you ?
yes , how do i get to your shop from chilin ?
go straight up zhongshan road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum .
do n't take too much off . i 'm trying to grow my hair longer .
how about two inches ?
that sounds perfect . do you think i can get some highlights today , too ? i 've always wanted red .
i think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .
all right . i 'll just have the cut and perm today .
great . my assistant will wash your hair , and then i 'll be back to help you .
oh , damn . there ’ s another traffic jam on the highway .
how can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?
there are just too many people , and too many cars .
i wonder if there was an accident .

well , one year would be fine , too . i ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
well , if it ’ s not a problem . then here you go .
just let me look at it quickly .
of course .
looks like a standard lease .
yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit . if everything ’ s all right when you move out , you ’ ll get it back .
o . k . great . just sign and date it here ?
yes . thanks . you can move your stuff in tomorrow .
excuse me , could you tell me the bookshop ’ s address ?

110 pounds .
really ? congratulations ! that 's really something beyond my imagination . how did you make it ? did you keep on a diet ?
no , you know i ca n't bear eating less .
then do the slim pills take effect on you ?
i 've quit it already . i go to aerobics class everyday instead .
how 's it going on ?
you see . i 've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
i 'd better exercise my body too . my limbs are rusty now .
i do n't think so . you look full of energy every day . time has stood still with you .
ahhs ! i 'm beat !
what happened to you ? you look like you got hit by a tornado !
i just got back from fighting the crowds .
you mean at the mall ? was there a sale ?

yes , emergency . there is a huge fire here .
calm down , sir . what 's your name and where are you now ?
my name is jerry and we are on the intersection of west road and east road .
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
of course ! it is the no . 1 stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses .
excuse me , is this the parcel counter ?
yes , what can i do for you ?
i 'd like to send this parcel , please .

100 frances .
mmm , it is reasonable . look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
we have a piece of table clothing to go with it . it is a brocade one with pretty stars .
this silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
you are right .
i will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
ok . do you like these candles ? they are on sale now .
it 's so boring .
do n't you like it ?
i do n't . is there anything worth watching on the other channel ?
i think it 's a basketball match on channel 5 .
do you mind if we switch over ?
well , i 'd rather see a movie .
what 's the movie ?
' star war ' .
it must be interesting .
where can i get my baggage ?

yes ?
could you tell me where the copy room is ?
doctor , save my baby , please
what symptoms does he have ?
he has had a fever for one day . just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . we were at a loss what to do . we called an ambulance and brought the baby here .
how long did the convulsion last ?
about 3 minutes .
does he have any other complaints ?
three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . yesterday , he began to have a fever .
have you taken his temperature ?
it was 38 ° c this morning and it was 39 ° c just now .
let me examine him to see if there is any rash . no rash .
is it serious ? is it meningitis ?
no , it is not meningitis . just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
no . no need for admission . i 'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . then i will give you a prescription . the pink tablets are used for his fever . when his temperature is over 38 ° c , give him one tablet . the other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . the white liquid is for the cold . give the baby plenty of water to drink .
thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! i ’ ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! let ’ s get started !
ok , let ’ s start opening some presents !

i always love skiing . you know , it 's a cool game for cool people . stay with me and you will be cool , too .
hey , look over there . it seems that there is something interesting going on . let 's go and have a look .
sure . it 's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey , do n't be so pathetic . it 's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
you are right . but what if the avalanche happened ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway , the show is breathtaking . by the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
do n't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
sorry . well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible . but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
it 's a good thing . ok , let 's go skiing .

i 've been reviewing your work over the past few months . thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . and you should get the perfect attendance award too .

heck no , we doubled the price , but because it 's you , i 'll let you have'em at 50 off .
you silver-tongued devil . ca n't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
hi . i ’ m here for flight 514 returning to beijing but the board shows there is a delay.how long of a delay is expected ?
so far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .
do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
i think you should stay in the airport . even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . who knows ?
what seems to be the problem ?
it seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . it happens all the time . no need to worry .
i need to go to the atm .
so , why don ’ t you ?
i have no idea how to use the atm .
what do you mean ?
this will be my first time using an atm .
i can help you with that .
explain to me how to use it .
just put your card into the machine .
now what do i do ?
then you need to type in your pin .
now what ?
would you like something to drink ?
yes please . do you have any teas ?
of course we have lots of teas ?

that ’ s oolong tea – it ’ s a cantonese tea .
may , is this the hall of ancient china ?
yes . look at these historical relics here , amazing !
why are they all in glass boxes ?
for protection . some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
so there is n't air in the glass boxes ?
no , there is n't . they are all vacuumed .
i wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
hey , look at the three-leg cup . i 've seen it on tv .
the bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . it 's priceless !

you shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . also , watch your intake of fatty food .
after watching my diet , what else should i do ?
you need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .

b , should we get a maid ?
i can do all the housework . we do n't need a maid .
you have worked very hard in the office . if we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .
we really do n't need to .
you are a good wife , julia . but you must take care of yourself .
is there anything i can do for you ?
excuse me , can i change my order ? i am afraid i do n't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .

yes . i graduated this past june .
which university did you graduate from ?
guangzhou university .

i received a bachelor 's degree in economics .

my major courses were microeconomics , macroeconomics , international trade , international finance , world economy , psychology and business english

503 . i would like to pay for it .
please fill out the form first .
ok , can you bring me a new one ?
what are you doing ?
i ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
let regive you a hand .
there are so many record players here . that is hard to choose .
look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
i 'd rather get one with separated speakers.they give a clear sound .
yes , but we should n't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that 's right . now this one looks alright ? it 's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it 's sony .
ahhchooo !
you 've been sneezing a lot lately . are you sick or something ?
no . every spring time around april , i 'm stricken with allergies .
i never have seasonal allergies .
consider yourself lucky .
what are all the symptoms ?
well , as you just saw , i sneeze a lot . also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
that does n't sound good .
no , it 's not . so you do n't have any type of allergies ?
well , i have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . it runs in the family .
everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
i get it pretty bad . my whole face turns red , including my ears . my eyes become bloodshot , and i start to itch all over my body .
that 's pretty bad .
let 's have a look at the map first .
all right . wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
let 's buy some tickets .
the train is coming . there are a lot of people waiting here . let 's stand in a better position to get on the train
well , it 's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
what do you do ?
i want to keep a pet , but i do n't know which one to buy ?
dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
what about cats ? they are more independent .
actually , i was thinking of something a little more exotic . i do n't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
yeah , are they easy to look after ?
can i be of any service to you ?
i 've been told that chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . we 'd like to take some home . what would you recommend ?
there are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.for example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the tang dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.do you have anything in mind ?
no , not really.but i think it should be something distinctively chinese . and easy to carry .
i would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.they are very easy to carry .
hey , mary . we 're back . have you eaten yet ?
i had some bread for breakfast .
let 's go out for brunch .
brunch ?
it is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . on sundays , many americans sleep late and go out for brunch . those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
hi , my name is sovia.what ’ s your name ?
my name is jeff .
what do you do ?
i ’ m a podiatrist . what about you ?
i ’ m a nurse.what do you do in your free time ?
i like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.and you ?
i like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
would you like to go out some time ?
sure , that ’ d be great.where would you like to go ?
anywhere with you .
oh , i 'm starving . i 'd like to try some real chinese cuisine . what would you recommend , waiter ?
well , it depends . you see , there are eight famous chinese for instance , the sichuan cuisine , and the hunan cuisine .
they are both spicy hot , i 've heard .
that 's right . if you like hot dishes , you could try some .
they might be too hot for me .
then there 's the cantonese cuisine and the kiangsu cuisine . most southerners like them .
what about any special beijing dishes ?
there 's the beijing roast duck .
oh , yes . i 've heard a lot about it . i 'd like very much to try it . where can i find it ?
you can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly quanjude restaurant .
is it near here ?
not too near but not too far either . a taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , if the traffic is not too bad , i mean .
well , thank you for your information . but what is the name of that restaurant again ?
let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . you can show it to the taxi-driver .
hi , isaiah . how are you ?
i ’ m well . and you ?

how ’ s it going ?
it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !
that ’ s such great news . i ’ m really happy for you ! where is your office located ?
our headoffice is here in beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon .
where will those be located ?
if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in hong kong in april and another one in singapore in october .
when will you find out ?
we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
well , good luck . i hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !
ant shirley , it 's being years since we last met . how were you doing in the passing years ?
pretty well . what about you ?
fine . where are the other guys ?
it 's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .
bad timing . i want to see them so much . how are they ?
not bad . i heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
yes , that 's why i 'm here . i 'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
did you go to a real estate agent ?
no , that will be too expensive .
that 's true . by the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
my first job 's salary will be a bit low . so the cheaper the better . just one i can afford .
sure . i 'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
merry christmas , bill .

oh yeah . the big napkin goes on my lap .
let 's look at our menus .

my left arm .

yes , it is . thanks . i ’ m just surfing on the internet .
here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i ’ m here . of course , i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that ’ s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ’ ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a

i could n't find the files you request , even though i checked all the cross-references . i do n't think it 's there .

i know that .
then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .

i 'm giving you a ticket for this .
i 'm sorry for the misunderstanding .

yes , mr . ford . the dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . have a seat .
is n't it past your bedtime already ?
i am not sleepy .
it 's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
there is no way that i can fall asleep right now .
try listening to some soft music .
it wo n't work . i 'm nowhere close to being tired .
i really do n't care , just go to sleep .
what if i stay up and do something , until i get tired ?
you 'll be up all night if i let you do that .
i 'm going to get to sleep eventually .
you need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
i want to go try on these clothes .
what did you find ?
i found some jeans , and a new blouse .
go and try it on .
what do you think ?
i love that shirt on you .
what about the jeans ?
they do n't really fit you right .
i do n't think so either .
that blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
well , i 'll just buy the shirt .
now , miss childs passed on your resume to me and i ’ ve had the chance to look it over and i must say i ’ m quite impressed .
thank you very much . i ’ ve tried to keep it short and clear . if there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .
well yes , i do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
yes , of course . well as you can see from the resume i ’ m 27 and grew up in brooklyn , new york , although our family moved to london when i was quite young , at around sixteen .
ah i see , so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us , i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ’ ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in saudi arabia too .
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i ’ m really looking to settle down .
can you tell me , ms . smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?
we ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .
what ’ s the result ?
we directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
that seems very impressive . good work !
well , good morning , tom . i have n't seen you for a long time .
i 'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .
what seems to be the trouble now ?
i feel run down , tired . i 've been having headaches almost every day . and i 'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .
have you been eating properly ? eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
well , i have n't been eating well , i guess . i usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
and what about dinner ?
sometimes i 'm too tired to eat anything at all .
that 's not good . you do n't have a well-balanced diet . have you been taking vitamin pills ?
thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us .
no , thank you .
would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ?
that would be great .
when do you want it delivered ?
i need it delivered tomorrow . will that be possible ?
what time exactly ?
i need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
we can have it to you at that time .
that 's not a problem ?
we will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
doctor , i have the worst toothache !
how long have you had this pain ?
for about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .
did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ?
you know , i was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and i accidentally bit down really hard on one .
what kind of toothbrush do you use ?
i just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .
does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
good evening .
good evening.my wife and i would like a room , please.is there any room available ? we do n't have a reservation .
let me see.yes , we have one room left.you ' re lucky.it ' s the last one .
good.we ' re tired after driving all day , and we 're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room .
this room has two double beds.it ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.it ' s quite a comfortable room .
how much is it for one night ? we only need it for tonight.we ' re going to continue our trip in the morning .
it 's forty-five dollars a night for two.is anyone else traveling with you ?
no , it 's just the two of us .
would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ?
credit card.we do n't like to carry much cash with us on our trips .
please fill out this registration card.here is your key.you can park your car in front of our room.check - out time is noon .
thank you very much .
let 's go to the animal shelter .
what do you want to do ?
i want to get a puppy for my son .
that will make him so happy .
i 'll get him one of those little dogs .
one that wo n't grow up too big .
and eat too much .
do you know which one he would like ?
oh , yes , i took him there yesterday . he showed me one that he really liked .
i bet you had to drag him away .
he wanted to take it home yesterday .
hello . i want to send the computer to my sister in shanghai by logistics transport .
ok . is it in the box ? may i see it ?
yes . this is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
is there anything else ?
there are a mouse and a camera .
is that all ?
yes . how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?
it depends on the weight of these things . generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
i see . can you weigh them for me , please ?
please go over there to weigh them .
what happened ? why did n't he win ?
did n't you hear ? he was disqualified .
how did that happen ? he 's so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
if he did n't have any drug problems , he would have won .
what ? what kind of drugs was he using ?
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
they are . the reason why they did n't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
that 's so disappointing . i do n't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
i do n't think it 's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
regardless of how much pressure you 're under , there 's never a good reason to take drugs .
i agree . hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
i need to use the atm .
what ’ s stopping you ?
i ’ m not sure how .
i don ’ t understand .
i ’ ve never used one before .
i can help you figure it out .
what do i have to do ?
slide your card into the machine .
then what ?
you need to type your pin in .
what do i have to do next ?
what are you doing ? checking the `` to do `` list for the wedding ?
yep . there 's still so much to do !
so let 's start by checking off what we 've already done .
did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the taiwanese guests ?
not yet , i was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the net .
cool ! i ca n't believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us !
it is my first time coming to china . i want to buy something unique of china to my friends as gifts .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques and porcelain . do you like them ?
yes , i love them , but they are fragile . it is not convenient to take them .
you are right . how about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
sounds good . may i have a look ?
of course . these paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
they are beautiful , but i ca n't understand the connotation in them . let me see the handkerchiefs .
all right . chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
oh , i like the bamboo design . what is this ?
this is a series of animals , called chinese zodiac .
good . so i will take three series and five bamboo ones .
can you make out what he 's saying ?
hi , nally , are you hungry ?
i 'm starving . let 's go grab a bite .
where to ?
how about karlis ?
are you kidding ? that place is too ritzy for lunch .
true . ok let 's go to grumose ?
same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
i guess it is a little pricy .
let 's stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch ..
that will be ok . come on , i ca n't wait to chow down .
that was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
is that why you stiffed the waiter ?
good morning , sir .
good morning . i 'd like a business suit made with this material .
do you have a particular style in mind ?
the kind that never goes out of fashion , i guess .
i think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
i 'm sure you 're right . i just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
the changes are usually not that dramatic . we just got some pictures of the latest fashion . would you like to take a look ?
good . i think i 'll choose this single breasted one . when can i get it ?
next friday .
oh , gosh ! i feel everything around me is against me .
do n't take it too hard . there are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
well , i am all ears . maybe they are helpful .
firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . and secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . the last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
i understand what you mean , and i will not upset myself . face it .
look , mary ! there are so many people over there !
oh , i remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .
i have never been to the personnel market .
really ? i have been there several times .
are there many employers ?
yes . the personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
so there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
yes , there are many famous corporations .
when will there be a job fair ?
every saturday and sunday
do i need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
no , it 's free .
how about going there to have a look now ?
could you show me the t-shirt on the model ?
here you are . we have three different colors , white , blue and pink .
what 's the price ?
$ 12 .
can you make it any cheaper ?
it is cheap .
i 'll take it if you give me a discount .
$ 10 . that 's the best i can do .
hello , again . did you discuss everything with your colleagues ?
yes , yes . it seems that everything is settled .
have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?
we have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees 's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .
that 's not a problem .
of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
we should plan to move out of here before july . i 'm tired of living in apartments .
i know , dear . i am too . but we 've just been too busy to look for a house .
we need to find a good realtor .
not necessarily . if we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
what do you mean ?
realtors always get a commission.if the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
but does n't a realtor help with the contract ? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
yes , that 's often true . but you have to pay them .
i still think we should have a realtor.we ' re new in this country . we do n't know all the laws of buying a house.and also , the realtor will inspect the house.he can tell us if the house has
of course we need a home inspector.but we can hire an inspector on our own.and as for the legal problems , i have friends . they can help us .
so how can we find a house if we do n't have a realtor ?
it takes a little more time . we have to check the ads in the paper.probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
and does n't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
sometimes they do , sometimes they do n't . it 's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
why ?
because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.he will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
hmm . it all sounds very complicated .
it is . but buying a house is very important . so it takes time.that ' s why we have n't done it yet . it 's very troublesome .
i want to look in the papers today . maybe we can see something we like .
which restaurant do you prefer ?
i 'd like to taste mexican food .
how about the one on baker street ?
the numbers in this table do n't seem to be in accord with reality .
oh , so the zoo is over there . thank you so much for your help .
you ’ re welcome . can i ask you what brings you to china ?
i ’ m actually travelling around asia .
oh , very nice . how long will you be in beijing ?
probably another week .
oh , i see . well , i ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
could you type up this document for me , sandra ?
sure , but i have to finish this report first .
are you interested in mountaineering ?
yes , in some sense . i should say i like mountain climbing , you know , because i 'm not so professional . how about you
i 'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . i went climbing in the rocky mountains with my friends last summer vacation . we spent two days in the mountains .
how did you spend the night there ?
we pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . wow ! it was too beautiful .
i had a similar experience , but that was on the top of tasha mountain in my country .
tasha mountain ? it 's very famous in china , is n't ?
yes . it is one of the five mountains .
i want to climb tasha mountain this summer vacation . would you be my guide ?
sir , what 's wrong with you ?
i have a spasm of nausea and dizziness .
have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? you 're probably airsick .
no , this is the first time on a plane . maybe you are right .. please get me some pills .
ok . i will get some for you . there 's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.please wait me for a moment . ( go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) here are two pills . and the water is in the glass too.please take the pills with water .
thank you very much . ( take the pills . )
are you feeling better now ?
much better now . thanks again .
hi bill , it ’ s jane .
jane , i ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ?
sure .
have you decided what you 'd like ?
yes . first i 'll have tomato juice .
and then ?
good morning , madam . what can i do for you ?
can you show me some traditional chinese arts and crafts ?
maybe sandalwood fan is good .
would you show me some ?
of course .
they really smell fragrant . how much is a real sandalwood fan ?
the small ones are one hundred yuan for each . and the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
i 'll take two small ones and a big one .
what else are you interested in ?
i 'm afraid not .
good morning.mrs.smith .
good morning ! can you help me , please ? i 'm looking for some books for my mother .
well , what kind of books does she like ?
she 's very fond of detective stories ?
i see.has she read any detective stories ?
oh , yes !
do you know if she 's read this one ?
i 'm not sure , but she probably wo n't remember if she has ! she 's very forgetful !
ah ! she has a bad memory.how old is she ?
she 's eighty-seven .
i suggest you take this book.it ' s very exciting .
hello , hot water overflowed from the bathtub . would you help me ?
would you turn off the tap ?
i did it .
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
ok , i will .
i will have our housekeeper come right away .
i am sorry , i was too tired to fall asleep .
when you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ?
hi . i 'm looking for a gift for my niece .
well , little girls seem to love barbie dolls .
that 's perfect . i want to see one .
here you are — she 's called digital barbie .
oh , i like digital barbie ! how much does she cost ?
this barbie is only $ 29.95 .
that 's perfect . let me have her .
very good . is there anything else you would like ?
no , that 'll do it for now .
including tax , your total will be $ 32.42 . cash or charge ?
let me give you cash , please .
please put your baggage on the counter and open it , let me have a look .
yes , sir . please examine it .
anything subject to duty in your suitcase ?
no , sir . nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
any cigarettes or liquor ?
i have cigarettes for my own use .
i think you 'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . and this article is liable for duty .
how much duty should i pay ?
one hundred dollars .
here is the money .
just a moment . i 'll make out your duty memo . ( writing and giving the memo to mr . green ) take it and pay the girl over there .
so that concludes the introduction . now let 's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . so first , right off the bat , when looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...
we wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
excuse me , sir , may i talk to you ?
bill ! sure , come on in . what can i do for you ?
well sir , as you know , i have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .
yes .
i won ’ t beat around the bush . sir , i would like a raise . i currently have three companies after me and so i decided to talk to you first .
a raise ? son , i would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .
i understand your position , and i know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
taking into account these factors , and considering i don ’ t want to start a brain drain , i ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . how does that sound ?
great ! it ’ s a deal ! thank you , sir !
before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?
are you going to vote on tuesday ?
of course . how about you ?
i ’ ve already voted .
how ’ s that ?
i sent in an absentee ballot .
why ?
i won ’ t be able to vote on tuesday .
why not ?
i have to work .
why don ’ t you go to work late ?
i have important business to take care of that morning .
did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ?
no . i have n't had a chance to read the paper yet .
you 've got to see it . it 's an unbelievable picture !
what 's so interesting about it ?
well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
what ? how did that happen ?
they think his dog was trying to wake him up and could n't , so ended up biting him in his face .
wow . what does his look like now ?
it looks pretty frightening . he does n't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . most of his nose and chin are missing too .
what did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
he was actually quite handsome . what a shame .
what 's he going to do now ?
excuse me . we 're leaving today . i 'd like to pay our bills now .
ok . by the way , i 'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12
i see .
have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , mr . green ?
yes , my friend and i just had breakfast at the dining room , but we did n't use any services .
how about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
please add to my account .
the total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
i 'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer .
what 's the problem ?
i need help turning them on .
you need change .
the machines take change ?
yes . it costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer .
where do i put the money in ?
you put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on .
that 's it ?
there 's nothing else to it .
thank you very much .
dad , can you lend me some money ?
what for ?
i want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
how much money do you expect in this position ?
with my experience , i 'd like to start at 3,000 rib per month .
well , it is a little more than we had planned .
could you help me with these books ?
my hands are full . can ’ t you see that ?
please , george .
i firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money .

i 'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
oh , so you 're thinking about buying a new car ?
yeah , it looks that way . my wife has been bugging me about it . i thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
so this would be your first automobile ?
that 's right . for quite a few years , i rode a bicycle to work . then i got a motorbike .
yeah , i think i can understand your wife 's position . asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she 's pregnant is a tall order .
oh ... i do n't let her ride with me . it 's just too dangerous . she takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it 's crowded and hot .
so it 's time to buy your very first car ! wow , that 's exciting !
yes , but it 's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
yeah . i still remember my first car . it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned 17 . i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
i 'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
yeah , it is a tough call . each one has its pros and cons . are you looking for a sedan ?
yes , i 'd like a jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .

well , how long will it take to arrive in shenzhen ?
couple of minutes .
great . how much ?
5 $ . you should change another much clearer photograph for fax .
good morning , can i see your passport , please ?
here you are .
for business or pleasure ?
business .
take care , peter . do n't run so fast . are you tired ?
oh , yes . may i sit on the grass ?
no , you must n't sit on the grass . do n't you see the notes ?

well , there 's a bench under the tree . we can sit there .

would you sign the register , pls ?
by the way , does my room have a private bath ?
certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
does my room have twin beds or a double ? i prefer a room with twin beds .
your room has twin beds , mr.lee . it also has a view . i am sure you will like it . this is your key . it 's on the eighth floor room 801 . the elevator 's over there .
thank you . one more thing , where is your restaurant ?

thank you , you are very kind !

i have a problem .
what ’ s the problem ?
someone else is making charges on my debit card .
i need to see a statement for your debit card .

yeah . for five minutes , everything was half off . it was total chaos ...
cool !
do you have a swimming pool in this hotel ?
we do n't have a swimming pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym .
i never heard of a swim station . is that like a train or bus station ?
it 's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
holy cow ! i never heard of such a thing . how much do they cost ?
as a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
this sounds better every second . now , when can i use the stations ?
if you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
oh , boy ! this is going to be great . i 'm going to the gym right now !
excuse me , bill ?
hi , christine . how ’ s it going ?
fine , thanks . mr . emory would like to meet with mr . macmillan tomorrow afternoon . can you take a look at his book ?

yes , i want to book a room .
sure . what kind of room do you like ?
well , could you let me see the room ?
ok . what about this one ?
it 's fine . what beautiful scenery outside the window ! i think this one will do .
i 'd like to buy a bottle of centrum , a dozen tooth brushes , some baby 's wipes , and a small bottle of aspirin .
centrum ? we have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets . which kind do you want ?
give me one bottle of one hundred tablets .
and what kind of toothbrushes would you like ?
can i have a look at them ?
sure . this brand is supposed to be very good , but they 're expensive . those are new products . they come in several colors and sizes . there is also hard , soft , and medium .
are they cheaper ?
this one is 10 % off . that one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes .
so if i buy a dozen , i 'll get two free tubes of toothpaste ?
that 's right .
good . i ' ll take a dozen of them then .
and here is your aspirin . what else did you say you want ?
baby 's wipes . johnson 's .

good morning , mr . smith . welcome to wuhan .
good morning !
mr . smith , did you have a good journey ?
i just feel a little tired . you know , it took me 16 hours to get here .
you must take a rest today .
that 's very kind of you , but i can do without a rest . i have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us .
we welcome good business . anyhow , we know you must get tired by the flight , so we arrange a meeting tomorrow . today you can have a good rest .
thank you very much .
we hope your stay here a pleasant one !
excuse me ! what time is it ? my watch stopped .
let me see . it 's 9
is your watch right ?
i think so . i set it by the radio this morning .
by the way , can you tell me what the date it is today , and what day it is , please ?
good afternoon . can i help you ?
i 'd like to leave this bag with you .
ok , sir . is there anything valuable or breakable in it ?
well ... there is a necklace in it .
would you mind taking the necklace with you , or leaving it at the safe deposit box ?
well , do n't bother . i 'll take it with me . will that be all right ?
thank you , sir . here is your tag . this cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
the atm machine outside wo n't give me back my card .
let 's go take a look at it . do you have your id with you ?
yes , here it is .
okay , i see the problem . you forgot your code , did n't you ?
how did you know ?
the machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it .
oh . but can i have my card back now ?
what 's the name of the girl that has just passed us ?
her name is rose.why ?
she 's so pretty . i 'd like to make friends with her .
excuse me , sir . are there only 3 programs in your hotel ?
of course not . we have 50 channels in all .
well . i am afraid it must be my fault . can you send someone here to help me ?
how do you feel ?
i 'm getting sleepy .
you 've had so long a flight .
time difference also makes me feel weak .
oh , i forgot about it .

good morning , may . good girl , you are reading english books again .

really ? a foreign parrot !
he can speak english , too .
maybe you can teach lulu some english words .
my mp3 player is broken , so i want to change it for an mp4 player . can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?
an mp4 player ? why do n't you buy a new cell phone ? you can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones .
oh , that 's a good idea . perhaps i should have a try .
look at my cell phone . i can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . it 's just like a pad .
that 's cool . i can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but i 'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .
that 's ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they wo n't cost you too much .
yeah , if i buy a cell phone like this , i do n't have to take a music player everywhere i go , and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .
that 's right . what 's the flash memory of your old mp3 ?
256mb .
what can i get you ?
a cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great .
would you like anything to drink ?
i feel like having a coke .

actually i feel quite rested . i was able to sleep on the plane .
good ! here , let me help you with your bag . is it your first time to seattle ? i 'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you 're up to it .
that will be very nice . you 're too kind .
i 've already made a hotel reservation for you , let 's go to the hotel first and drop off your things . then , i 'd like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted . i 've booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown . afterwards , i 've made arrangements to take you to see the city lights . seattle ’ s nightlife can be really quite exciting . how does that schedule sound to you ?
