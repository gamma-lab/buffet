some what ?
weed ! you know ? pot , ganja , mary jane some chronic !
oh , umm , no thanks .
i also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines .
no , i am ok , really .
come on man ! i even got dope and acid ! try some !
do you really have all of these drugs ? where do you get them from ?
i got my connections ! just tell me what you want and i ’ ll even give you one ounce for free .
sounds good ! let ’ s see , i want .
yeah ?
i want you to put your hands behind your head ! you are under arrest !
what for ?
they want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline .
it is really a hot potato .
that 's excellent . how have you managed that ?
mainly because we 've invested in a heat recovery system .
what does that mean exactly ?
well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
what other sources of energy do you use ?
we do n't use any fossil fuels . most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . we 're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
well , people from asia to europe all enjoy tea .
right . and china is the homeland of tea .
yes , chinese people love drinking tea so much . some even claim they ca n't live without tea .
do you know there are several catagories of chinese tea ?
yes , i believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . any others ?
well , have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea ?
oh , yeah . oulong tea is good for one 's health . is n't it ?
you surely know a lot about chinese tea .
sure , i like drinking tea at teahouses .
oh , so do i .
why do n't we go for one now ?
great . we can chat while enjoying a cup there .
let 's go !
i ’ m afraid i ’ m a poor talker . i ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business , so i have been studying public speaking .
are you more of a leader or a follower ?
i don ’ t try to lead people . i ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ?
yes , in most circumstances .
are you available for travel ?
yes , i like travelling . i am young , and unmarried . it ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently .
i think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours .
you ’ re right . we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
ok . you haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ?
no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car .
i think it ’ s over five meters long . i can ’ t remember exactly . it has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
wow ! that ’ s fast ! i don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
we can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
do you want the truth ?
of course , i do .
well , you really did n't do all that well .
how bad did i do ?
to be completely honest , you failed your test .
how ?
there were a number of reasons .
what were they ?
basically , you just ca n't drive .
can i have another try ?
you can take it in a couple weeks .
good morning , doctor . i have a terrible headache .
all right , young man . tell me how it got started .
yesterday i had a runny nose . now my nose is stuffed up . i have a sore throat . and i ’ m afraid i 've got a temperature . i feel terrible .
do n't worry , young man . lat me give you an examination . first let me take a look at your throat . open your mouth and say'ah ' .
ah .
your throat is inflamed . and your tongue is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza .
what am i supposed to do then ?
a good rest is all you need , and drink more water . i 'll write you a prescription .
thank you very much .
red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms .
what about soup ?
sour-peppery soup .
which condiment do you use for ?
i 'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
very good , need i help you ?
no , do n't need , i can do myself .
thanks . i can watch tv now .
but you must cook that dinner next time .
okay , i 'll do it next time .
mike ! good to hear from you . how are you ?
everything is fine , and how are you ?
things are going well with me .
kara , i had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this friday .
mike , i do n't think that it 's a good idea to go out again . i really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home .
maybe we could just meet for coffee or something .
i ca n't really deal with any distractions right now , but i appreciate the nice evening we spent together .
yes , i have booked a room for 24th . it 's a double room .
hold on , please . let me check it for you . yes , you 're right . you will keep it for 3 days .
well , now i want to change the date from 24th to 28th .
ok , that shall be arranged .
i 'm free . what 's up ?
someone has to pick up the boss at the airport .
oh , i just remembered i 've got a report to write .
it 's ten after six.we ' re late.but dinner is at six thirty .
i know . i know . i 'm really sorry . i lost my bag .
i 'll call the lost and found office .
i did n't think of it.thank you.and i do apologize for being late .
do you have the ' the man and the sea ' by ernest hemingway ?
yes , we have one copy left .

yes , here you are .

it 's free of charge .
thanks so much .
no problem at all . could i have your full name , please ?

my plans are to be there april 14th to the 17th .

well , it depends on the price , of course . what is it ?
it 's $ 308 a night .
i have no problem with that .
great ! would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
definitely nonsmoking . i ca n't handle that smell .
nonsmoking . now , is a queen-size bed okay ?

of course ! it 's area code 626-555-1739 .
thank you so much , mr . sandals . we look forward to seeing you !
certainly , sir .
i 'm afraid there 's been a mistake .
i 'm sorry , sir . what seems to be the trouble ?
i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here .
i 'll just go and check it for you , sir .
yes . i bought this sheet here yesterday .
anything wrong with it ?
yes . when i spread it out back home , i found this hole .
oh , how awful ! may i have a look at the invoice ?
here it is .
well . please accept our sincere apologies , i 'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .
that 's very kind of you . thank you .
we 're sorry that this has happened , and i guarantee that the same mistake wo n't happen again .
perhaps you 'd be interested in red roses .
what would the roses cost me ?
they 're only $ 20 a dozen .
i like the sound of that .
yes , that is today 's sale price .
a dozen will be fine .
is there anything else you 'd like to get ?
no , thank you .
these roses should make your wife very happy .
yes , i am afraid there are not enough outlets .
well , we have 6 for each room .
yes , but 4 of them are broken . can you send someone here ?
ok sir , please wait a minute .
are you aware that you drove through a red light ?
i ran a red light ?
yes , you did .
i apologize , but i did n't realize that i did .
were n't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
i did learn that .
so , then why did you speed up ?
i do n't know what to tell you .
i 'm going to have to write you a ticket .
i understand .
here you go . do n't do that again .
surely of course .
here is the film . can i get my pictures tomorrow ?
sure .
besides i want two copies of all the photos .
my name is dunlin and i live in beijing . i was born in 1980 . i will graduate from peking university this july . i have majored in accounting .
would you tell me something about your family ?
there are three in my family , my parents and myself . my father is a teacher and my mother is a worker .
i have to start eating better too .
what kind of food do you usually eat ?
i try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
is that really all that you eat ?
that 's basically it .
how do you stick to only those foods ?
actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
yeah , i know , but what about the chicken ?
i mainly eat baked chicken , because there 's not a lot of fat .
that does sound pretty good .
i know it does , and that 's because it is .
could you show me where the chinesc-style clothing is located ? i want to buy a silk coat .
this way , please . here they are . they 're all handmade .
oh , they look nice . may i try that black one on ?
of course . the fitting room is right over there .
do you have a medium in the same color ? this one is a little tight .
l 'm sorry . all the black of that size are sold out . would you like a red one ?
ok . let me try it on . what do you think ?
oh , that suits you very well . besides it is believed in china that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
really ? i'ii take it and i 'm leaving here tomorrow . is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
our pleasure . please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
thanks . how much would that come to ?
let me see ...
great , thanks .
can i help you ?
i would actually like to view the apartment for rent today .
i ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today .
why not ?
you have to make an appointment first .
oh , okay . can i do that right now ?
is this friday okay ?
is 6 o ’ clock friday evening okay ?
yes , i will schedule you for that time .
thank you very much . see you then .
thank you . i wonder whether i can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance .
of course . a two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek .
good . anything else ?
yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
yes , i want to send a registered airmail letter to france .
ok , it comes four dollars twenty cents .
here is five dollars .
here is your change . please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
i also want to pack up my package . this is the notes .
let me see . en .. just a minute . here it is . i need your signature on this note .
oh , one more thing , where can i mail this letter ?
drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
thank you very much .
you ‘ re welcome .
of course . i 've loved writing since i was a very little boy . i won the first prize in a national composition contest when i was in middle school . after attending nanjing university , i never give up writing . my works , such as father 's tobacco pipe , open air cinema , the old city were respectively published china youth daily , yangzi evening news , and new beijing . during the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , i paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . the impact of internet in chinese political participation , the discipline of remold , the historical direction of chinese administration reform , bribery cases of self governance in chinese villages are respectively published in chinese publish administration , beijing due xuebao , theory and society and chinese reform . i joined in yangzi evening news to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . during this period , i 've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , i have full confidence in my writing ability , and i believe i can do the job well .
yes , i 'd like to reserve a table for dinner .
how large a group are you expecting ?
six couples .
would you like to reserve a private dining room ?
that sounds like a good idea .
all right . may i have your name , sir ?
my name is ron kollwitz .
no , but i 'll be able to tomorrow .
that 'll be too late .
why do n't you ask bill if he can help ?
i did , but he was n't able to either .
yes , i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past two years . i plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . sometimes i have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent .
do you have any practical experience as a secretary ?
yes , sir . i acted as a secretary in an insurance company .
would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?
well , to begin with , i would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average .
have you had any experience with computer ?
yes , i studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer .
that 's fine . what about operating the fax and duplicator ?
i can handle them without any trouble
what have you learned from jobs you have held ?
above all , i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed .
very good .
where have you been ? i 've been trying to get in touch with you for two days .
i went to salt lake city on business . what 's up ?
i got fired .
how come ? last time i saw you . you told me it was a good job , and you 'd like to take it as a career . that was only one month ago . why this sudden change ?
it 's a long story . in a word , i did n't do a good job of it . i messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up .
what are you going to do now ?
i am trying to find a job asap . lily does n't know yet . i did n't tell her . i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought i went to work as usual .
that 's not the way to solve the problem . did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
yes , i did . but i was n't qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in .
listen . i will see what i can do , ok ? you go home and tell lily about this problem you have now . she is your wife and i am sure she will understand .
i just do n't know how to bring it up . well , all right . she has the right to know anyways .
i 've never gotten one . have you ?
i got a ticket yesterday .
really ? what did you get one for ?
i parked in the red zone .
why did you do that ?
i needed to get something really quick .
where did you park at ?
at my apartment building .
do n't you have your own parking spot ?
i needed to be fast .
that was very lazy of you .
i ’ m having a problem .
what problem are you having ?
there have been charges made on my debit card that i didn ’ t make .
do you have the statement for your card ?
here it is .
what are the charges you ’ re referring to ?
the last four charges on the page .
i ’ m afraid we ’ re going to have to investigate these charges .
how long will an investigation take ?
i honestly don ’ t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
that sounds absolutely fantastic .
i do n't know . can i purchase treasury certificates here at this counter ?
yes , of course . we have treasury notes with two , three and five-year terms available .
two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 rib .
ok , could i take a look at some id please , like a passport ?
here you go . by the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ?
no , i 'm afraid that is n't possible . you must wait until maturity before you cash them .
this is professor clark speaking .
hi , this is kalina from your morning literature class .
yes , what can i do for you ?
i had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today .
my goodness ! are you ok ?
i broke my leg , but it is healing .
how long will you be out of class ?
i should be able to return by next monday .
fine . well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . i hope you feel better soon .
yes , yes i did . please come in ! i ’ m so glad you came ! this old house is falling apart ! come on into the bathroom . see , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere !
i see . let me have a look . it seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . let me just get my plunger . no , that ’ s not working either . i suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . that ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow .
oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . she is always flushing things down the toilet . you know how kids are .
yeah , i have a little one myself . anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . i could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent .
that would be great ! is it expensive ?
let ’ s see ... i would say about eight hundred dollars .
i 'd like a beer . what kind of beer do you have ?
draft beer and cans beer . which do you prefer ?
a draft beer please .
ok . here you are .
could i have some fruit ?
of course . wait for a moment , please .
fine , thank you , and how are you ?
very well , thank you . it 's nice to meet you again . i am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as i was busy yesterday . i do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from new york .
yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . thank you .
how are you getting along with your business ?
not bad . the fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .
i hope we can do more business together . though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . in the meantime , let 's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .
toilets are in the rear , i am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
what ? oh , what we live ! thank you very much for your help , miss .
you are welcome .
you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage .
that ’ s a really long line . how long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?
it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait .
can i buy stamps here ?
sure . how many would you like ?
i need 30 for my christmas cards .
are you sending them abroad ?
twenty of them are going abroad to china and america .
do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do , those are less expensive .
no .
ok , here you go . that will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
and the bubble wrap ?
that ’ s another quid .
thanks a lot . you ’ ve been very helpful .
i am cooking now !
are you good at cooking ?
i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant , so i have to practise cooking !
it is a good idea . what dish are you cooking now ? !
i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . have you ever tried steamed fish ?
yes , i have . but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . the fish is not well-done and too salty .
that 's the case . i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
i have the same idea as yours .
it 's ok . please have a taste of it .
thank you . oh , it 's very delicious .
thank you for your praise .
besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?
i am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .
so many dishes . next friday week is my birthday . i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , ok ?
why not ? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
thanks a lot .
it 's my pleasure .
this is room 2012 . where is my laundry ? you promised to send to me this morning .
well , let me check for you . i am sorry , sir . they mistook your order as a normal one.actualty it 's an express laundry , is that right ?
yes , i ordered the express service .
sir , we are terribly sorry for that.we will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . is that all right ?
that 's fine .
what is it ?
can you mail this at the post office for me ? i have to go to the doctor for an appointment and i do n't have enough time to go to the post office .
sure . and i 'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor 's .
would you please fill some gas for me ?
sure . which kind of gas do you want ?
unleaded , please .
ok .
it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
what about a draft at 120 days sight ?
all right . but we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
a bank 's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
so do i .
i have n't seen her yet .
i think that she is very pretty .
tell me how she looks .
she 's kind of short .
what height is she ?
she 's probably about five feet .
that 's nice , but tell me what she looks like .
the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .
i think i might 've bumped into her before .
are you telling me that you 've seen her before ?
i believe so .
yes , and i want to buy the insurance too . i think it 's necessary .
you 're smart to buy it . at 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .
can i return the car in san francisco ?
san francisco ? no , sir.we only have this office here . you will have to return it here .
really ? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities .
no , sir . that 's only with the very big companies . i 'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .
well , i guess i will have to drive back down then . hmm . i did n't think of that .
do you still want the car , sir ?
yes . it will be fun . driving back down the coast . my girlfriend will like it .
it 's a beautiful drive .
where are the keys ?
just a moment , sir . we have to finish filling out the forms .
sure . just leave it to me . i 'll finish it .
speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . let 's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood .
sound great . let 's go !
look at the crystal clear fridge . you can see so many kinds of seafood in it . they all look very fresh and delicious .
true . i would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .
you sound like a seafood expert . i would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps .
you are not too bad as well . i also want to have a steamed lobster . it is really taste like heaven .
let 's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .
wait . let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first .
ok . i will wait for you inside the restaurant
do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ?
i 'm going to the hospital .
get in . i 'll take you .
about how much will it cost ?
it will cost you $ 10 .
by the way , what 's the time ?
you can see the time on the meter . i have radio time , you know .
it 's a quarter to 12 . could you please drive a little faster ?
certainly .
where was it from ?
it was made in jingdezhen .
jingdezhen ? is n't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?
you are right .
this is the very thing i 've been dreaming of .
it is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell china .
it must be most precious .
but it is really worth the price .
hello , i am going to the store to buy some fruit .
oh , would you do me a favor ?
yes ?
please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
sure . do you want it to be registered ?
yes , i think so . there are some pictures in it . it would be a great pity if they were lost .
yes , i will be glad to mail your letter .
thanks .
you are welcome .
alright .
it does n't work . it looks like it 's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there .
oh , yeah ? it 's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital .
damn it ! i 'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police .
well , you 'll just have to wait . i 'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i 'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . do n't worry . you 'll get to the hospital in time .
it really hurts .
yes , maybe it does.but if you 're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
to hell with you . the accident was your fault .
i 'm afraid it was n't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it was n't . but enough of this bickering . i 'm going to go find a phone.don ' t move that arm while i 'm gone . alright ?
to hell with you .
hello . i 'm thinking about watching a chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . what 's on this weekend ?
well , there will be charity performance on saturday night . and also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on sunday night .
it 's a good thing that i have choices here . can you tell me about the one on saturday ?
sure . it 's to raise money for the homeless .
what about the performance itself ?
oh , it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
wow , a story about the clever monkey king . it 's a classic and children 's favorite .
it surely is . and the cast is really the best .
wonderful ! how much is the ticket ?
the price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .
well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .
i tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and i 'll come by at around 3:00
that 's fine with me . how much time are we going to have to work on this ?
perhaps one year , i 'm not sure .
french dressing , please .
i beg your pardon ?
oh , french dressing .
sorry , it 's not available now.anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
certainly . and what vegetables would you like ?
oh , spinach , i think .
fine , and what about something to drink ?
just a beer , please .
good . thank you.sir .
would you like to have some more beer ?
no , thanks . i ' ve had enough . i 'll have my bill , please .
of course . please wait a moment . i 'll go and get it .
thank you .
sure . first of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
yeah , that 's very important .
so you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .
i ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
that ’ s right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .
it ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans .
i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
it ’ s a pity that i can not afford more expensive clothes .
you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
it seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
it may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
what a pity !
if you do n't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?
that 's ok .
hello . i need to find out if a receipt of proceeds has arrived . i 'm from felix wasserman associates .
thanks . have you got the l / c number ?
it 's nx567822100007 .
hang on a tick and i 'll check for you . i 'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
ok , thanks for checking . could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
no problem . i 'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
yes . i have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?
are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ?
i would prefer the first one .
sure . we have a one-day trip along the river . it 's quite beautiful .

well , we have a lot of models here.did you want to listen to cd 's or cassettes or the radio ?
mostly cassette tapes .
alright . there are several models you may want to look at.this kreng portable cassette player is very good .
kreng ? i 've never heard of that company .
it 's a german company.this unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an am / fm radio band.it also has a built-in microphone .
i suppose i do n't want that one then . i do n't like auto-reverse . it breaks too easily .
really ? have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
yes , twice now . i think it 's too high-tech , and so it 's the first part that breaks .
hmm . you know , the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ?
well . no , i did n't clean it.but still , i only had the last one two months , and it broke . i do n't trust auto-reverse .
alright . well . we have many units without auto-reverse.here is a good unit . very reliable.it has an am / fm band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse .
how much is it ?
this one sells for $ 39.99 .
can i test it out ?
of course .
it sounds great . i 'll take it .
fine . i think you 'll be happy with it . it 's a very good unit . very reliable . i 'll go get you a new one in a box . i will be back in just a moment .
thanks .
i was born and raised in beijing . i attended peking university and received my bachelor 's degree in economics . i have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in beijing for china pacific insurance co . ltd .
what type of position are you looking for ?
i 'm looking for a position in which i can utilize my experience .
are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
i am more interested in a full-time position . however , i would also consider a part-time position .
can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
i advised customers on financial matters . after i consulted the customer , i completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . i then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . the clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that i formulated on a quarterly basis .
what is your greatest strength ?
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
what is your greatest weakness ?
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however , i began setting time-limits for myself .
why do you want to work for our company ?
after following your firm 's progress for the last 3 years , i am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and i would like to be a part of that team .
when can you begin ?
immediately .
well , all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
what are they ?
they are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
and what is the most important point ?
you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
yes , they were . but it has already past . the traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of yan'an aerial road .
we 've never expected that shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as new york city . david , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? i 've got an international driver 's license with a pretty good record in the states .
that 's wonderful . ok . i 'll remember that . but i have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there 're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people do n't take road regulations seriously .
you can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside . let ’ s go inside .
i don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here .
i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better .
it is just too dark in here with so few windows .
i hear that the kitchen is quite large . let ’ s go check it out .
the kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space .
the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . maybe it will be a little better .
how many dogs live in this house ?
i think that we have seen all that we need to see here . let ’ s go look at another house .
have you decided what wine you would like ?
i have no idea . maybe you can give me some advice .
i recommend you the white wine . it will wake up your appetite .
that 's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
engaged ? she ’ s married .
johnny , i wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . haven ’ t you a tongue ?
yes , mother , but my arm is longer .
not a problem . what time shall we call you ?
i always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .
it 'll be our pleasure . we 'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen .
oops , cancel that . change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
no sooner said than done . can i help you with anything else ?
no , that 's about it for now . thanks .
okay , sir . have a pleasant evening .
yes , i have , mr . thomas . we 'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton .
take it easy.you ' ve made enough preparations .
i 'm in such a need of the job that i ca n't afford any mistakes .
i 'm sure you 'll pass it .
let me see . laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... oh , that is too much . you are not going to a business trip .
i guess i need all of them .
actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time .
suit yourself . don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock .
yes . i want to go to beijing hotel .
i 'm sorry . you are going in the wrong direction .
oh no ! what shall i do ?
do n't worry . you can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . the bus stop is right there .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
hum ... why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? tomorrow is saturday . i hate all the hustle and bustle of saturday shopping .
but sunday is the same with saturday . if you don ’ t mind , that 's ok .
hum.maybe it will be better . the most important thing is that i can have a day to relax after a week 's work .
i see . we will go the day after tomorrow .
by the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
i want to buy some clothes in clothing store . when we are going back , go to the butcher 's shop and buy some chicken .
let ’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . i want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
thank you , darling .

no , thanks . i ’ m all set . good-bye .

this is rachel in human resources . i need two boxes of company letterhead , one box of ball-point pens , and a box of envelopes .
all right . no problem . what ’ s your extension ?
yes , certainly . how can i recognize him ?
he is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair .
is there anything else ?
he has a mustache , if i remember correctly , and a light complexion .
how old is he ?
he is in his late thirties .
well . i shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . what time does his flight arrive ?
at 2 thirty .
could i get a hamburger , please ?
would you like cheese on that ?

let me have a soda .
what kind of soda would you like ?
may i have a sprite , please ?
sure , no problem .
i would also like a bag of chips .
will that be all ?
that 's everything .
i majored in international banking at college so i took many insurance courses . and i worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work .
why do you want to be an insurance agent ?
i care about people and i know the importance of insurance .
do you have any work experience in promotion ?
yes , i do . i have worked as a salesman for p & g company ltd .
do people respond well to you ?
yes , i 'm good with people .
this is the place i was telling you about .
would you like to sit near the window ?
good .
let 's have a look at the menu . oh , there is n't a menu . do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
yes , of course . excuse me . could you possibly let us see your menu ? oh . they have n't got one either .
i ’ m thinking about it . how much is it ?
¥ 350 .
oh , dear . it ’ s too expensive . can you give me a better price ?
your discount is already included . normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . this is our sale period .
it ’ s still too much . can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that ?
sorry , but this is the best price . you can ’ t get it any cheaper than here .
i see . can i pay by traveler ’ s checks ?
i 'm afraid you can ’ t . you ’ re welcome to pay in cash .
sure . what do you need ?
i 'm having some trouble . how do you use this printer ?
well , first you have to turn this switch on .
silly me .
now press this button .
oh , and it 's out of paper . do you have any more ?
just a second . i 'll go get some .
tell me what the problem is .
i ca n't figure out how to turn them on .
do you have some quarters ?
i did n't know i needed change .
the washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
where do i put the change ?
the quarters go into the slot . you have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
is that everything that i have to do ?
that 's all there is .
i appreciate you helping me with this .
if you need anything else , just let me know .
yes , do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation ?
yes , after you ’ ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation
only three days ?
that 's the company policy .
what happens if i use up my sick days before the end of the year ? if i ’ m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
yes . that 's the company policy .
it was the same as the last place i worked at . i was hoping you ’ d be different .
yeah . i am too .
where did you want to go for lunch ?
i was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .
i do n't think i ever got food from the cafeteria .
i actually like the food there .
does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?
they have anything you want .
i was thinking about getting some chinese food .
i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . it tasted great .
we can eat at the cafeteria .
i think you 'll really like the food there .
that 's ok .
the contract is to be written in chinese and english . both languages are equally effective .
fine . if you 'll excuse me , i 'd like to go it over first . ( after about 15 minutes ) hmm , you 've done a pretty good job . it 's well prepared .
thank you .
well , i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .
that 's a good idea .
first , let 's read clause two about packing . it 's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . that 'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . so , we 'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .
agreed .
for shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it wo n't all be finished at one time . so would you allow us to make partial shipments .
i understand your position .
certainty.do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?
i prefer single breasted suit .
what about this one ? it 's a very nice 3 - piece suit .
that looks great . do you have ties here ?
how do you do , jack . nice to meet you .
well , i think you ' ve reconsidered our proposal , diane .
yes , you are right . after all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . the only problem is price .
i should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . do you have any suggestion in mind ? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .
that 's why i came to your office today . we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .
that 's true . but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you 'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
i see your point . that 's to say s 611 each set . still it 's much higher than the market price . could you see your way to reduce the price , jack ?
well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . that 's the best we can do . what do you think of that ?
all right . we accept it . so $ 600 for each set .
very well . thank you .
i 'm not sure.you look familiar .
you 're mr.stevenson , right ?
yes.and you 're mr.jones , i remember .
yes , i have an overall understanding .
when we have the final results , we will call you .
then when will i get a reply at the latest ?
if you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .
but if i do n't pass , will you call me ?
i 'm sorry we wo n't . you can wait for two weeks . if you do n't get a telephone call , it means that you were n't successful .
then do i have the chance to get this job ?
i 'm sorry but i ca n't make the final decision myself , and i have to discuss it with other interviewers .
i know . no matter what the result will be , i have learned a lot from our conversation .
your mentality is very good and that 's great .
thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .
my pleasure .
well , you 'd better lie down now . you need a good rest .
all right . i 'll do that .
yes . i was president of the student council of our university .
did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years .
were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
yes . i was a member of the student poetry society . i like writing poems in my spare time .
what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
i sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball .
what 's the criteria for staff to attend ? are we only including our management team in this affair ? or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?
lower level employees need not attend . the purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . we want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . in order to get everyone to jell together , we 've got to include some fun . that 's the reason for the retreat .
why ?
because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too .
i do n't know . i just need to try it once . i 'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
you should try swimming then . it helps you to keep fit .
i think my english is fairly good . as you can see from my cv , i graduated from university with a b . a . degree in english . i studied the english language and english literature systematically .
how are your typing and shorthand skills ?
i can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in english at 120 words per minute .
yes . when can i get them back ?
well , if they are collected right now , you can get them back tonight .
that 's fine . by the way , please have that suit dry cleaned .
ok . please fill in the form first .
is your blood pressure , i 'm afraid . it 's far too high .
and what 's the cause of that ?
overwork-amongst other things . you ca n't work 24 hours a day . you ' ve got to slow down .
but i ca n't just slow down .
you 've got to , i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size .
you mean i 've got to lose weight ?
yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
exercise . the morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . we should not pass them up easily . seize the time and do something useful .
so , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . where do you exercise ?
usually , i run to the black bamboo park as a warm-up . admission is free . then i start my activities .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
no , i 've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . i alternate them over the weekdays . sometimes , when i find myself in a bad state , i will simply idle about in the park .
why do n't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?
it 's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it 's interesting to join them .
oh , yes . singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .
i think pond 's is the best .
and they 're very dear , too .
they 're on special offer today .
oh , that 's ideal .
first , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight .
i will go to bed early tonight .
do you have an airsickness ?
i do n't know . but i have a carsickness .
you 'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .
thank you .
can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
either way is good for me .
there are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . would that okay with you ?
i can take a little time off of work , or i can go on a weekend , also .
we could meet at the real estate office , or i could pick you up at your home .
i am leaving from work , so maybe i could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .
i can think of five houses that we should look at . it will take most of the day .
i would like to see as many as possible .
when i have confirmed the times with the owners , i will e-mail you our plans for the day .
yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ?
the seven-days trip shall be fine . how much is this tour ?
$ 300 .
we will take the trip . could you give us a pamphlet ?
here you are .
enough is enough . i know .
i 'm sorry , mrs . lin . we do n't allow smoking in the office .

it should be due in at 7:30 a . m.tomorrow .
how much is the ticket ?
it 's 86 coach and 175 berths
one berth , please .
where to , sir ?
beijing library .
hop in , please .
is it a long ride to beijing library ?
it will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour .
thirty minutes , that will be all right . there are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open . look , what are they doing on the square ?
it is an exhibition of chinese jades . it is held each year . a nice collection jades of are on display and sold .
sounds great ! can you stop somewhere here for a minute ? i will get some souvenirs for my friends .

here you are .
this is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . have a good trip !
thank you !
do you have any seats for september 16th ?
let 's see ... i 'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . but i have seats for the 17th .
the 17th will be fine .
and what date will you be returning ?
hmm , i guess on the 28th .
okay , you 're booked on american airlines flight 710 , departing jfk at 6
sounds good . thanks a lot .
do you have any special brand in your mind ?
no , i never wear suit in my everyday life . i just want one to take part in my sister ’ s wedding ceremony .

but it looks good . let me try it on .
ok , the mirror is over there .
i am looking for a pair of shoes .
do you like high heels or flat shoes ?
high hells , please . i want to wear them in formal situations .
sure , what ’ s up ?
some of us are going to start a soccer team . would you like to join us ?
i don ’ t know anything about it . soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here .
that ’ s all right . we ’ ll teach you .
is it anything like american football ?
not very much . it ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
i ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like .
good idea . i think you ’ ll like it if you give it a chance .
yes , g stands for general audiences , pg means parental guidance suggested , r is restricted to audiences under 18 and x means explicit content .
does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
remember when we were kids ? theaters would n't let kids in to pg moves without a parent .
i remember that i never saw an x moves even displayed .
now with video rentals it 's all a personal matter .
yea , i never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we wo n't .
the material is so abstract that i have trouble understanding it .
yes , i would like to reserve a room for next monday .
wait a moment , please . let me check it .
by the way , i want a large room .
right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
yes , that 's what i am looking for . i will take the room for 2 days .
sorry , i can ’ t ! i have to go to work , pick up jake and maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take jake to soccer practice and maddie to dance class .
you sound exhausted . maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! she can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . she can also help you do some household chores , and run so
oh , i don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . you have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . i would love to have
i think you should definitely consider it ! this way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . i can refer you this great
oh , that ’ s great . thanks grace . can you give me her number ? i ’ ll talk it over with dan and give her a call tomorrow . maybe this way i won ’ t be so tired every day , and dan and i might even get to go
what are you excited about ?
i voted today .
was this your first time ?
i just turned 18 a month ago .
you ’ re lucky .
what do you mean ?
because you turned 18 in an election year .
i didn ’ t even think of that .
you didn ’ t ?
i really didn ’ t , but i ’ m still excited .
you should be , because you ’ re a part of history .
yes . i want to buy a pair of shoes .
have you a pattern in your mind ?
well , maybe sneakers or rubber shoes .
is there any special brand you would like ?
could i have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? they look nice .
what 's tiananmen famous for ?
it is largest pop square in the world.you see that is monument for the people 's hero , and the chairman mao memorial hall on the south.there is great hall of the people on the west.there are two museums on the east .
what 's that ?
that 's the forbidden city on the north of gate building .
all the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive.travelling to china is very worth one.thank you so much for your guides , and i 'll miss you .
we 'll have to get you to a hospital . i can ride you on the back of my bike .
i 'm lucky i was n't killed . i must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.there was too much gravel on that corner . i slid out .
yes , i almost slid too.alright . this tourniquet is tight . how does it feel ?
make it tighter . i want the blood stopped.then wrap some bandages around the cut . then we can go . ouch ! i hope i can walk .

there . stop !
well , unfortunately i have got something to do this weekend . but let me see ...
oh , i 'm sorry.however , if you could help me out , i 'll double the pay for the hours worked .
that 's very kind of you.how soon do you really need them ?
i 'll need them for the conference on monday afternoon.do you think it can be done by then ?
i 'll try .
thank you very much , mr.james .
how can i ever thank you ? i owe you a big favor .
sorry to hear that . can we do anything about it ?
i 'm afraid not .
then i have to call another taxi , or i 'll be late .

look at the heels . they are slanting .
ah , i can do it perfectly .
how much does it cost ?
6 yuan . and i can make them as new as before .
i think it ’ s too expensive . i can just give you 4 yuan . or i ’ ll go to another b .

how long will it take ? could you repair them while i wait ?
yes . they will be ready in a few minutes .
great ! i ’ ll just sit here and wait .
hello , is that stefan ?
i 'm sorry , but i 'm afraid you 've dialed the wrong number.there is no stefan here .
really ? are you sure ? i called before and he was there .
yes . i 'm sure . you have the wrong number . i have used this number for more than 20 years .
that ca n't be true . i remember the number clearly . is your number 1199886 ?
no , it is n't . it 's 1199866 . it seems that you have misdialed .
oh , i 'm sorry i bothered you . i 'm really sorry .
it does n't matter . it happens to everyone .
sorry again for bothering you .
that 's all right .

thanks . please sit down . she ’ ll be with you shortly .
thank you .
we have a great variety of chinese antiques . besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting .
i 'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
how about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? it was painted by a famous chinese painter in king dynasty .
oh , they look just like live cranes .
and what is more , in traditional chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
yes , it 's $ 167 .
thank you .
it looks wonderful . very authentic .
the chef trained in florence . the pasta is very good here .
ok . so , what can you recommend ?
hum ... you should try the mushroom fettucine . it 's really good .
is it salty ?
not at all . it has a very delicate flavor .
what does ' duppa del giono ' mean ? i 'm sorry i do n't know how to pronounce that .
oh , that means soup of the day . i 'll ask the waiter what they have today . have you tried mussels cooked the italian way ? they 're really delicious .
no . i 'll try them . sounds good .
anything you would like to know ?
what qualities do you expect the applicants to have ?
we expect the usher girl to be good-looking , no less than 165 centimeters high , and love smiling .
yes , actually i ’ m looking to buy a camera .
we ’ ve got a wide selection do you know if you ’ d like a point-and-shoot , or something a little fancier ? are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ?
actually i ’ m buying a camera for my husband .
ah , well then i ’ d recommend a nice entry-level digital slr .
yeah ? can i take a look at the sirs you carry ?
sure thing , follow me . this here is the .
the canon eos . yeah it ’ s ok , but i ’ m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .
oh , ah , um the nikon d60 is a nice option .
yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? i don ’ t want some bulky telephoto lens .
oh , well this one has the , uh .
looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
so , ahem , can i interest you in any acc ...
accessories ? do you carry polarizing filters ?
polarizing filter um we should ! i ’ m sorry , ma ’ am . it looks like we ’ re sold out .
no you ’ re not ! there are some right here !
oh , well , would you look at that ! polarizing filters .
thanks for your help , ralph !
no problem , ma ’ am .
that ’ s certainly true . but , that ’ s what this job is all about , maria . there 's no doubt that this project is unacceptable .
i agree . but i think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . i ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .
all right , maria . i ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it .
you do ? how are you going to contact him ?
i 'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen .
what does it say ? do you think he 'll see it ?
he 'll see it . it says , i like sweets . meet me at two thirty in the parking lot .
can i spy on you guys from the window ?
no . but i 'll fill you in later . right now i have to find vince .
i 'd like to have some more . it 's really good .
no , you 'll have to get off at the bank , and take a no . 50 .
thank you.how much is the fare to that stop ?
one dollar .
how many stops are there ?
two stops after this one .
could you please tell me when we get there ?
sure .
by the way , do i need a transfer again after no . 50 ?
no , a no . 50 will take you right there .
thank you .
very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . the only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress .
when will that be ready ?
the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
you ’ re getting married in three weeks . so that should be ok . so , you ’ ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
yes . we ’ ve taken care of all of that . we decided not to get married in a church though . neither of us is very religious .
which hotel will the reception be held at ?
the palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . i ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job .
oh , yes . it ’ s and excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
yes . it will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
i think you make the right decision .
yes . actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available .
can i try this one on ?
sure , go ahead .
the color is too bright.for my age , i would prefer a lighter color .
let 's see , sir . according to your file , you watched ' titanic ' monday evening .
well , the wrong information is in my file . i was at a concert monday night .
well , your word overrules the file , sir . one moment , please .
i knew you 'd see it my way .
sir , i deleted the $ 10 , but i had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
am i in the twilight zone ? you 're charging me for a movie i never saw ?
please do n't blame me , sir . blame the computer programmer .
this is highway robbery . i 've got a good mind to call the police !
if it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
how nice of him . i 'll be delighted to go . but what time would be convenient ?
if you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , i 'll be at the hotel to pick you up .
that 's great . it 's most thoughtful of you to do this , miss rose .
it 's my pleasure . well , then . i 'll say goodbye .
goodbye and see you tonight . miss rose .
yes , of course . here it is .
thank you . are all these yours ?
no , some of them are my friend 's . do you want her passport , too ?
yes , please . do you have any carry-on items ?
do you want me to put it on the belt , too ?
yes , please . would you please open this big suitcase ?
ok . just a moment . it 's just some clothes and toiletries .
ok . do you have anything to declare ?
i think there is nothing .
any fresh food , live plants , or animals ?
oh , no . none of that .
thank you . you may lock up your suitcase . here are your passports .
thanks a lot .
yes ?
i bought it one size up by mistake .
oh , did you ?
i wonder if you can change it to one size down .
yes , of course.will you come with the receipt ?
then i 'll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ?
until 8 o'clock , ma'am . we are looking forward to seeing you .
why , do we need groceries ?
i believe we are all out of food .
do you know what to get ?
i do n't know what we need .
why do n't you go and check the refrigerator ?
i would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
why do n't you just get the basics ?
what do you mean ?
eggs , milk , bread . things like that .
go make that list .
sure , no problem .
since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there should n't be any problems for the contract .
may we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice .
yes , i got it . thanks .
yes , can i help you ?
well , this is my baggage claim tag . can you get my baggage now ?
ok , here you are .
thanks a lot .
i was unable to make it .
you should have been there . it was intense .
is that right . who ended up winning ?
our team was victorious .
i wish i was free that night . i 'm kind of mad that i did n't go .
it was a great game .
what was the score at the end of the game ?
our team won 101-98 .
sounds like it was a close game .
that 's the reason it was such a great game .
the next game , i will definitely be there .
no , never . i prefer to actually see and touch what i 'm buying before i pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .
that 's right . seeing is believing .
i 've heard some friends say when they get the article , it 's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
that happens . without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
what 's more , it 's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
it 's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . paying online is much safer than before , but i still have the feeling that it 's not safe enough .
i ca n't agree more . that 's why i only do street shopping .
me too . sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
that 's a good idea .
it is 15 minutes ’ drive .
what companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
mitsubishi , hp , ibm and many other famous corporations .
does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
it ’ s such a large firm . do we have our own staff restaurant ?
yes , at the end of the hall .
good morning , i have an appointment with mr . johnson at 10:00
excuse me , sir , but are you mr . richard of world trading company ?
yes . that ’ s right .
i ’ m sorry , mr . richard . mr . johnson is on his way to the office . he had just called and asked you to wait a minute .
well , i ’ ll wait .
would you like something to drink , sir ? do you prefer coffee or tea ?
thank you . coffee , please .
here you are , mr . richard . this is the cream and this is the sugar . if there ’ s anything else you ’ d like , please don ’ t hesitate to tell me .
thank you very much .
i need to report a break-in .
when did this break-in occur ?
last night .
where did the break-in happen ?
it happened at my house .
was anything taken ?
i 'm not sure yet .
what makes you think there was a break-in ?
my front window was busted .
i 'll send a squad car .
please hurry .
you do n't need to introduce yourself , yang . you 're famous .
well , thank you very much but i thought l 'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .
ok , ok !
now , i 'd like to get things under way . the main topic on today 's agenda is the development of a u . s . sales strategy for the new ebb . i 'd like to hear all of your ideas , mr . wall , you seem in top form today . could you start the ball rolling ?
uh , oh , sure . well , i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
well , that 's kind of obvious .
give me a break , mr yang .
uh , let 's keep this going , shall we ?
what do you mean ?
it looks like the shipping company did this .
we 'd better take it up with them , in that case .
no problem , if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering .
well , as you know , i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon-bons here in the united states . they ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .
mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? belgium ?
actually , the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ’ ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here , i brought these especially for you , try one !
oh , thanks . mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...
unique , aren ’ t they ? i bet you ’ ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes , very interesting flavors ... slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i ’ m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what ’ s haggis ?
it ’ s a traditional scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach .
ah , get back to you .
mr . johnson ? mr . johnson ?
yes , we are just looking for one . what 's the charge per day ?
it 's $ 20 . if you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .
that 's reasonable .
yes , that 's right .
i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor .
oh , yes . i remember .
monica , wait a moment . i think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it .
i think i can handle it by myself .
i ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.yeah , thank you for telling me .
don ’ t mention it .
when did you finish ?
this morning ! no more overtime , and no more headaches !
well , i ’ m glad to hear it . have a cup of coffee !
did you mail us your last continued claim form ?
i am afraid that i forgot to send it in .
we can not pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks .
is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now ?
it can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .
i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .
you can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . if you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !
will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form ?
your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time .
i 'm ready when you are , sir .
very good ! now , it 's still morning here in new york .
you are so right , sir . the clock just struck nine .
i 'm going to spend some time exploring the city . what can i do with my luggage ?
sir , right here we have a storage site . its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .
a deposit ? is n't my luggage a deposit ?
i 'm sorry , sir , but it is n't . your mastercard or visa will take care of things nicely .
okay . let me think about this .
okay , sir . but do n't take too long . you only have 30 minutes .
yes . i 'd like a cup of onion soup .
and what would you like after that ?
i 'd like the roast chicken , please .
yes , i know and i like it very much . i will take it .
sure . here is your receipt .
how long is this cell phone guaranteed ?
you can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year .
it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he ’ s in a bit of a jam .
why ? what happened ?
well , his son had an accident and bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . this really got me thinking , and i wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different hmo ’ s .
yeah , you ’ re right . we aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . the deductibles are low , too .
sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine .
i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
not in a million years !
yes , of course . there are many steps . you can apply for the job on the internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company . and wail the feedback of the company .
what is the qualification needed by the position ?
you must have over 2 years'experience first .
played poker with my work friends .
did you win ?
of course .
can i see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ?
sure .
let me just make sure . you want to withdraw one thousand dollars ?
that 's right .
yes of course . this is a really good one actually .
how much does it cost ?
this one is 1500 yuan .
it looks pretty good . i think i 'll take it .
would you like anything else ?
that 's all thank you .
what is that ? it looks like something from a swamp !
it 's a green drink . it 's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
you know , healthy eating does n't have to make you gag .
the sales lady said that even if i eat right , i would n't get enough vitamins .
have you ever tried it ? or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
it 's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
it may take less time , but i do n't know about easier . yuck .
the rent is $ 1500 per month .
and how much is the deposit ?
the deposit is $ 500 .
there is the balance of net liabilities . this must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .
right , ok . that , again , should n't be a problem .
and the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year .
well , as far as i can tell , we qualify .
of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . as soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
yes , i know a little about japanese which is similar to chinese not only in culture but in language itself .
what band did you pass in japanese language proficiency test ?
i passed the band two in lpt , but i will try to achieve band one which is the highest level .
i ’ m in pretty bad shape , doctor ford .

it 's more than special . you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it 's a world of exotic pets .
that 's terrific . i ca n't wait to check it out .
hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
why not ? it 's so cool .
but it will pose a risk to your health .
pardon ?
i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
well , i did n't realize that .
i do n't believe it 's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
oh , i should have thought of my brother 's baby girl . maybe i 'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
yes , good luck , maria .
hold on a minute , please .
thank you .
i am sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you .
would you bring the message to my room .
i 'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
then i 'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
ok , we wait for you .
i think i may have seen it on the kitchen table .
you 're right , thanks . there 's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that i want to finish .
who 's the director ?
it 's martin scorsese . you liked his film , the departed , did n't you ?
yes , it was fantastic ! can i read the article when you 're finished ?
sure . you know it has an online edition , too . you should go online to read if you want to read it now .
that 's ok . i 'll wait until you 're finished . just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
no . i do n't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
how much does the magadize cost ?
it 's almost three pounds now , and i think they 're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
that 's quite expensive . who is their target audience ?
cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
i bet you 'll still buy it , though . you would n't be able to live without your fashion magazine !
bargain ? i 'd feel way too guilty .
but you could have saved money .
from a sweet ma ? ! it 's not worth it . plus , i 'd happily pay more for these things i bought !
f . y . i . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you 're done ...
ha ! i 'm just warming up ! please take me there now !

i want to find information on the american civil war .
well , can you be more specific ? there are a lot of websites about that .
yes , i want to know about the battle of gettysburg .
o . k . well , go to google.com , and type in “ battle of gettysburg . ”
oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
here , try this one . it ’ s a good site about gettysburg .
thanks .
for detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
thanks . if i ’ m interested , i ’ ll go to the library .
ok . you ’ d better come back in two hours .
i 'm afraid he 's away from his desk at the moment .
do you know when he will be back ?
he 's away on a business trip . he wo n't be back until some time next week .
is there some way i can get into contact with him ?
the best way to reach him is by cell phone . i 'll give you his number .
thanks . and could i have his e-mail , just in case i ca n't get him by phone ?
sure . his cell phone is 09112223 33 . and his e-mail is lower case t , smith -- that 's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .

i 'm in pretty bad shape , dr . ford .
oh , in what way ?
no appetite , always on edge , and i ca n't sleep well .
did you lose any weight ?
yes , i have lost quite a few pounds since last month .
when was the last time you had a check-up ?
about two month ago .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
well , mr . brown , i 'm happy to say it 's nothing serious .
you 're just a little run-down from overwork .
what am i supposed to do ?
i think all you need is just a vacation .
try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest .
thank you , doctor . i 'll do as you say .
morning , michael . i ’ ve been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i ’ ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown.coffee ?
no , thanks . i ’ ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .
haha , i could never do that . i ’ d be a zombie if i didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . let ’ s get down to business then .
yes . i ’ ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing , and pear has been falling behind in the market .
that ’ s great ! i ’ m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ?
no , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
surely . let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract .
you have ordered a red dress , is that right ?
yes . is that available now ?
yes , here you are . try it in front of the mirror .
did i hear about it ? i saw it happen .
are you serious ?
i was there .
what happened ?
a man came into the bank with a gun .
that 's insane .
i was so scared when i saw the gun .
then what happened ?
he took the money and tried to get away .
did the cops show up in time ?
he did n't even make it out the door .
hello ! i was exhausted form studying , so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately , the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i ’ m shocked that the pole
people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
you mean if they catch the murderer . i ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
well , there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
well , they ’ ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment .
i ’ m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that .
i ’ m sure they are . oh , and a local man won the lottery . i ’ m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i ’ m amazed that i haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . it ’ s so unfair !
don ’ t be moody ! i hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
let me see . the bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . it comes to $ 210 .
is it possible for you to reduce the price ?
i am sorry . it 's a one-price shop .
yes , i 've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . where are they ?
i 'm very sorry to hear that . may i have your name and room number , please ?
yes , it 's yao lan . room 406 .
and how many pieces did you have ?
two suitcases and a handbag . the suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .

toilets are in the rear . i 'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
what ?
no , this is n't .
could you please get him on the phone ?
sure . wait a minute .
why do n't you wear a scarf ?
what can wearing one do for me ?
you 're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . it 's not because your jacket is n't thick enough .
so wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
yes . that 's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
you know , sometimes i ca n't feel my ears and fingers .
i 'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
thanks , pam . you 're my lifesaver .
the most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . do you know all about them ?
yes , i pretty much understand the company .
well , after you 've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . have you decided what they are yet ?
yes , i 've been observing them .
when you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . have you chosen what to wear ?
i already have something to wear .
i would always be ready to go shopping with you ! should we talk about other basics ?
ok , i am ready to think of other things .
you need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . you 'll do great !
would you please show me that mural ?
certainly . here you are .
it looks so beautiful . how much is it ?
four hundred yuan .
that 's a bit more than i wanted to pay . can you cut the price down a bit ?
i 'm sorry . ours is a fixed price shop and i can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .
maybe you are right . ok , i 'll take it .
well , i 'll have it wrapped for you .
thank you . here is four hundred yuan .
thank you . please come again .
i feel sorry for you . it 's a jungle out there .
do you know any places ?
well . i guess i can ask around to see if anyone 's got a room or apartment available .
thank you . i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone 's got a sublet .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
i can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
looks like you 'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
it does n't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
anything you need to have in the place ?
i want a bedroom with full bath , and it 'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
you can also check out university bulletin boards .
why ? will those be students who are leaving ?
not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
thank you . i 'll be sure to take a look .
good luck .
hi , i 'd like to order some flowers .
who are they for ?
they 're for my wife . her name is samantha .
what kind of flowers would you like ?
i do n't know . i do n't know too much about flowers . can you recommend something ?
ok . what 's the reason you are sending her flowers ?
today 's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers .
do you know what kind of flowers she likes ?
i 'm not sure . i know i should know that , but i ca n't remember right now .
well , they 're for your wife , so i think you should give her roses .
roses will be fine .
what color ?
i think red would be nice .
do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ?
can you deliver them , please ?

241 main street .

i need to take a few classes .
what kind of classes would you like to take ?
how about a driver 's course ?
okay , you 're going to need to make an appointment .
i do n't understand why i need to make an appointment .
you need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork .
i 'd like to make one now if i could .
sure you can ; when would you like to come in ?
i 'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9
that 'll be fine .

does he have a temperature , doctor ?
no , he doesn ’ t .
must he stay in bed ?
yes . he must remain in bed for another two days . he can get up for about two hours each day , but you must keep the room warm . where 's mr williams this evening ?
he 's in bed , doctor . can you see him , please ? he has a bad cold , too !
what would you like to know , mr . green ?
what working experience have you get ?
in 2004 , i got a job in the sales department of a trading company near guangzhou . i started a sales representative . a year later , i was promoted to the position of sales manager . i had that job ever since , which is just over a year now .
oh , good . irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? do n't you like your present job ?
frankly , some part of it i enjoy very much , but i prefer something more professional . it happens that i have a friend working here in this company . she told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . i felt very excited at this news . that 's why i 'm here .
yes , it 's very nice . all our foreign visitors enjoy it . the food is wonderfully well-prepared . let me know if you need any help with the menu .
thank you . mmm . can you tell me about the terrine ?
yes . a terrine is a kind of meat pate . it 's meat turned into a paste . it sounds horrible but it 's actually really good .
mmm . maybe another time .
you could try the ravioli . they are rather like your chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .
sounds good . i think i 'll have the lamb for my main course . what does it come with ?
well , you can have fries-french fries-or simple boiled potatoes .
i 'll have the potatoes . what are you having ?
i 'm having my usual . i like the fish here . would you like some wine ?
oh , yes . that would be lovely .
would you like those with yogurt ?
sure , why not ?
what else would you like to add ? we highly recommend caterpillar fungus .
caterpillar fungus ? ! what the heck is that ?
it ’ s a special kind of chinese herb . it ’ s good for you !
what 's so great about it ?
what do you mean ? it 's a scrim .
not to me , i would n't be caught dead in that .
i love that kind of stuff .
yeah , you seem to like those styles .
sure do . i get a kick out of looking punk .
this one looks really expensive though .
i do n't care how much it costs . i 'm rolling in it .
lucky you ! i ca n't buy anything else . i 'm flat broke .
i got a replace my party outfit , i trashed it last week .
why did you drag me into this ? i 've spent a week salary .
are you on the level ? you 're the one who called me , remember ?
just joking , tonia . i 've got some wonderful clothes . let 's go and have a close look at your outfit .
we have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences .
experience is important , but do n't you think capability is more valuable than that ?
yes , i think so . but how do you prove to me that you are more capable ?
maybe you can hire me on trial . if i 'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
good idea .
yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road .
i 'm a stranger here.how can i get there , please ?
just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you 'll find it on your right .
thank you very much .
so , this 500 rib is worthless ?
i 'm sorry but it is our regulation , so i must follow it . we will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so .
right , i see . let me give you another 500 rib .
here 's your passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 rib worth of counterfeit notes .
thanks . now can i make the full deposit ?
yes . please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue .
do we have to ?
come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .
it ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . it gives the room a good atmosphere .
a good atmosphere ? the tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room .
but it makes the place feel so much like christmas . i ’ d really hate to have to take it down .
but christmas was two weeks ago ! it ’ s been there only because we ’ ve been too busy to get rid of it .
i know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
but it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
i know , i know . but it reminds me of the great christmas we just had . all of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
yeah , it was a good christmas . it won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should .
ok , fine . we need to take down the tree .
i ’ ll make a deal with you . we ’ ll leave it up until sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church .
i 'm ask for a pizza , please .
then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . two for one .
you 're right , that is great .

what 's the weight limit ?
20kg.yours is not overweight . here is your boarding pass and baggage tag.please go to the satellite hall to wait for boarding .
thank you .

yes , smoking or non-smoking ?
we 'd like a non-smoking table , please .
come with me , please .
yeah , of course . you can take a taxi .
how much will that run me ?
it depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable .
do the drivers speak english ?
some are better than others . but , you should n't have a problem .
are they safe ?
for the most part , yes . if you do n't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
sure . what time do you want to go ?
how about at 3:30 ?
that sounds good . today we work on legs and forearm .
hey . i just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . let 's work out on arms and stomach today .
i 'm on a weekly schedule . you 're messing everything up .
c'mon . we 're only switching two days . you can do legs on friday .
aright . i 'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then .
i knew everything would work out for you !
i got to meet the night anger today too . we got along right from the start .
wonderful ! do you already have your work schedule ?
not yet , i pick it up tomorrow .
do you know what you will be doing yet ?
yes , i 'll be managing the guys on the dock .
you 're so good with people . i think they will like you !
hello , yes , i ’ d like to open a bank account .
certainly , i can can help you with that . what type of account would you like to open ? a chequing or a savings account ?
what what features do they offer ?
well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
i see , well , i think i ’ m more interested in a chequing account . i like to have easy access to my money .
alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . will you require overdraft protection ? there is an extra fee for that .
no , that won ’ t be necessary .
in that case , i ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . i ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government id . if you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ’ ll be all set . would you like to make a deposit today ?
yes , i ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars .
sure . do you want to have the car washed ?
yes , please . when can you get it done ?
you can pick it up in half an hour . by the way , how are you going to pay , cash or credit ?
by credit .
yes . i ’ m going to travel around europe .

oh yes and try lots of new food too .
great . make sure you buy me a souvenir !
oh , don ’ t worry , i will !
it ’ s nice to meet you , too .
i am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate .
would you like to ask me anything ?
what do you feel about gay marriage ?
i think everyone has the right to love who they want .
would you legalize gay marriage ?
yes , i would .
many people won ’ t like that .
i ’ m sure they won ’ t , but that ’ s my view on gay marriage .
i really like you .
i really appreciate that .
this is mr.white speaking .
hi . i understand that you have a house for sale , haven ’ t you ?
yes .
i ’ d like to know more about it .
can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ’ clock ?
ok . i will be there .
thank you for calling.goodbye .
bye .
all right . which room shall i have ?
room 202 , but i 'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200 .
no , there 's a definite difference . you know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they 're the financial control system . then there 's the ceo — the chief executive officer . he 's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . it 's too dangerous . that 's the reason for a board of directors . the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . they could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
how many people are on the board of directors ?

let 's line up . the steak is very inviting . i 'll have it .
i 'll have ham and egg with french fries . what dessert do you want ?
banana pie .
where shall we sit ?
how about there ?
i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.it gives me a real sense of satisfaction.do you enjoy cooking ?
i don ’ t like it.it takes up too much time and i really hate having it clean up after the meal . i can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
you can ask the guests for help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes .
so what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food .
italian , indian and chinese . i ’ ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice .
do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ?
not at all.you can find most of them in supermarkets.the ingredients are usually the same as in western food.the way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .
how long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?
obviously , it depends on what i ’ m cooking.but i ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
you came to the right place . any particular decade ?
if you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
we just got one in yesterday , so now we have six .
would any of them have dancing figures ?
yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
oh , they 're both so beautiful . let me have this one , i think .
that one truly is a beautiful piece of work , is n't it ?
one last question
oh , no . everything we sell here is `` as is . ``
i guess i was asking for too much .
if it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the internet .
why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !
who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
i will ! i ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
we ’ re planning on having children soon , i don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let ’ s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ’ ll tell you what , i can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
yay !
but i have n't used exercising equipment before . can you tell us some more details ?
certainly . we have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on .
working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . what else do you have ?
here 's the swimming pool . it 's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . there are also massage rooms here .
that 's wonderful ! i like swimming .
i 've already told my buddy , mark , that i am going hunting with him in alaska .
you ca n't be serious !
hey , i 've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . i am sorry that bothers you .
after a year together , i thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
says who ? i do n't think that is necessarily the case .
you know , now that i think about it , i really do n't have much more to say to you at all !
whatever you say !
not yet . i do n't know how to fill out the form . what is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
i do n't really know . why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? they will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . he can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
if i do n't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
certainly . no one who evades tax can escape from their detection.they ' ll check your income through computers . you 'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . if you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
i quarreled with my roommate last night . he is really stubborn .
calm down ! shouting won ’ t help ?
he is really outrageous .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog , so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep , because brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me .
what ? he ca n't do this to you .
well , he did it anyway . then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .
what did you do ?
i shouted it back of course .
hold it , mike . you wo n't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? you worked it all up till now . why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
what would you do if you were in my shoes ?
just stay cool . you know . when you get back home tonight , tell him that you did n't mean to quarrel with him .
no way , kate . i mean it 's just not my fault .
i know . it would n't hurt much to say sorry first . and after that , you can casually mention the problem . i am sure he will cooperate .
i am too angry to do that .
charles dickens.actually no one can parallel him in writing .
i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you on that . i like d.h.laurence ' s novels better .
i like board games . i like chinese chess and draughts .
i ’ ve never played chinese chess before , but i ’ ve seen old men playing it in the street . it looks complicated .
it ’ s about as complicated as chess . the basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
i like playing cards . i ’ m pretty good at poker . do you play cards ?
i ’ m terrible at cards and so i never play games which involve gambling , like poker . if i did , i ’ d lose all my money .
do you play bridge ?
yes , i do . it ’ s hard to find four players though , so i don ’ t play very often . do you know anyone who plays ? if so , we could set up a game .
i can play quite well . i have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . shall i invite her to play ?
sure , i have a friend who play fairly well . we should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
i ’ ll call my friend now . you call yours .
sure . the coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . the drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights .
what about the hotel accommodations ?
you 'll be staying at holiday inn . it 's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool .
great . what types of things will we do at lushun falls ?
the second day you take a four-hour city tour . in the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
oh hello , sally . this is dave thomson here . could i speak to jim please ?
i 'm afraid he 's not in at the moment dave . he went out about an hour ago and he 's not back yet .
any idea when he might be back ?
well , he should n't be long . he said he was just going to get some paint . but i would n't be surprised if he 's stopped off at the pub on the way back .
ok . well , tell him i 've called , will you , and i 'll try again later .
all right . goodbye , dave .

wait ! don ’ t turn it on ...
i 'd like to talk to somebody about the group account deposit service .
this refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies .
what is it used for ? i mean , why bother to get this special account ?
group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries .
i see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . interesting ...
yes , sir . what can i do for you ?
i want to buy some specialties . can you recommend me some ?

fine . they look nice . i will take both of them .

that sounds good . but i have a proposal now .
what 's the proposal ?
both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
good idea ! in this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
sounds like we have the same idea .
generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements .
how should i contact them ?
you can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database .
can i get a quick reply from the sites ?
yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while .
cross the street and walk two blocks west.you ca n't miss it .

my skin is oily .
then i advise you to buy the lay cleansing milk .

i 've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes . but the line has been engaged all the time . why is it taking so long ?

sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . how do you feel about that ?

mr . smith , i 's like to ask you a question .

i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .
the starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence .
i think it 's acceptable and i really like the job . and when can i know the decision ?
we 'll inform you of our final decision by early july . do you have any other questions ?
no . thank you for the time .
we have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible .
i also realized this issue . and office automation is essential .
besides , internet tends to be more essential now in the information age .
good idea . a network of work stations is helpful for our management .
and , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function .
you are right . the current equipment of our offices really falls behind . next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment .
i need to book a plane ticket to london .
round-trip or one-way ?
one-way .
what date would you like to fly ?
saturday , july 25 .

i want to see you right away .

thank you for saying so . have you seen the exhibition halls ? on display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
oh , yes . i had a look yesterday . i found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . the exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . i ’ ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . i ’ ve got some idea of your exports . i ’ m interested in your silk blouses .
our silk is known for its good quality . it is one of our trade - trional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . they ’ ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
sure . what do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ?
i need help with food .
ok , well , let 's coordinate our efforts . should this party be formal or casual ?
i think it should be casual .
i agree . next , we have to decide on food . we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine . which one should we have ?
i would prefer chinese food for this party .
perfect choice . for music , should we have a live band or a dj ?
i think we should hire a live band .
ok then . well , i will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on friday .

i knew there would be a few choices , but this selection is huge !
you 're looking for a multi though , right ?
that 's right . just a simple multi-vitamin that i can take every day .
okay . then i recommend this one . it 's made especially for men about your age .
oh ! you took the guesswork right out of that one .
that 's my job ! is there anything else i can assist you with ?
okay . is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ?
it 's natural . my friend told me you know how to work with curls .
that 's my specialty . let me put this around your neck .
do you have any product that controls frizz ?
with the cut i 'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .
thank you !
and when we 're done , i 'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest .
okay . say when .
i 'm not in the mood .
it 's the circus .
i do n't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
oh , come on , they give them treat too.oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
cute ? hope so .
oh , it is coming to us , come on , ben , get a banana to it .
me ? no way , keep him away from me , please .
why are you acting so strange today ?
i 've said that i 've got a problem with the circus . i 'm not kidding .
that 's weird !
all right , madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % .
that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future .
have you received any honors ?
yes . i got the title of `` advance worker `` in 2006 .
do you have any publications ?
yes . i wrote a thesis entitled `` on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy `` and it was published in china daily .
hi there , everyone . we hope you 're having a good night !
was n't that football game great ! i just knew we 'd win !
the night is young , folks . get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday .
later we 'll let you know who the king and queen of the reunion will be .
but for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . get out on that dance floor !
yes . go to the next corner and turn left onto center street . walk three blocks to second avenue and turn right . walk two more blocks and you 'll see city hall on the left .
i 'm sorry . i did n't follow you . could you please repeat that ?
okay . first , go to the next corner and turn left onto center street .
uh-huh .
then , walk three blocks to second avenue an turn right . are you with me so far ?
yes . i 'm following you .
then , walk two more blocks an you ’ ll see city hall on the left . have you got all that ?
yes . now i 've got it . thank you very much .
nothing much , what 's going on ?
i 'm having a party this friday .
oh , really ? that 's nice .
i wanted to see if you wanted to come .
this friday ? sorry , i already have plans .
doing what ?
i 'm going to dinner with my family .
i really wanted you to come , but i understand .
yeah , maybe next time .
i 'll hold you to that .
sounds like a plan .
it 's simple . you can use call transfer .
is it so simple ?
sure . you know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so i receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so i need pay little for receiving calls .
it 's true .
call transfer has many other advantages . when i am in places where network ca n't cover , such as the high building , i also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and i will not miss any call .
that 's all ?
in hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . if you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .
tomorrow morning ? what about tomorrow afternoon ?
then i 'll see you in the afternoon .
ok .
welcome . one of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation .
what else do i need to do ?
you inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests .
you still have time on your lease .
there ’ s no way that i can stay here .
that ’ s not going to be all right .
i don ’ t understand why .
i ’ m going to have to keep your deposit
why can ’ t i have it back ?
because you ’ re leaving before your lease is over .
you have to give it back to me .
you ’ re not going to get it .
but i ’ m not able to live here anymore .
i can ’ t help you with that .
here it is . 350 yuan all together .
may son adores my new hairstyle so i suppose it is worth it .
hearing you say that is a big reward for us . and here is the receipt .
thank you .
wait ! congratulations ! you are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration .
wow , it 's surprising . so what do i get ?
you can have a free facial and then make up free for you . do you want it now ?
probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i ca n't afford now .
here is our number . call us when you are ready to come .
you mean i should make an appointment ahead of time ?
yes .
got it . bye for now .
i am sorry , but i ca n't lend it to you now , for i have n't finished reading it . if you do n't mind , i can lend you some back numbers to you .
that would be very kind of you . by the way , is it a monthly magazine ?
no , it is a fortnightly . so , you see , i can get the new one quite soon .

that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute ... go to this one . i ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . i don ’ t play many games on my computer , but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program , you

thanks . well , those two kids are beginners . what should i do about their safety ?
well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . first , make sure they do n't go far from the railings .
oh , yeah , maybe i should ask them just to walk along the railings .
that 's a good idea . and remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
ok . anything else ?
never go to the center of the lake . the ice there is too thin to skate on .
got it . thanks for reminding me . and , are there any intensive training courses ?
mike , you 're late again .
i 'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so i
do you think i believe the story like that ?
but it 's true .
how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
that 's coincident 。
ok , hold it . remember to be punctual next time 。
i promise i will .
you 'd better .
something important ?
yes . i have just booked two tickets .
tickets ? what tickets ?
two air tickets .
air tickets ?
yes . we will fly to paris the day after tomorrow .
we ? the day after tomorrow ? what are you talking about ?
today is june 18 , isn ’ t it ?
yes . so ?
think about it !
then it is june 20 the day after tomorrow .
yes . think about it carefully .
oh , come on . tell me please . why did you book tickets to paris ?
oh , honey ! don ’ t you remember this important day to us ?
sorry .
it is our 10th wedding anniversary this june 20 .
our 10th wedding anniversary ?
of course . you completely forgot it .
darling . i think you have made a mistake .
i have made a mistake ?
yes . we married on july 20 ten years ago .
july 20 ? but i think it should be june 20 .
yes . we had planned to marry on june 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
yes . i remember now . we put it off . i did make a mistake . but how shall we deal with the tickets ?
since you have booked . then let ’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
no , thank you . check , please .
wait a moment . i will calculate it for you . your bill comes to $ 36 .
here are $ 40 . keep the change . that 's my tip for you .
how to do it ?
just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line .
how long will it take to reach the buffet ?
not long , because people rush for lunch .
the line sure does move fast .
tell the man behind the counter what you want .
ok . i like that green vegetable but i do n't know how to call it .
just point to it if you do n't know the name .
all right .
yeah , but i 'm still waiting for my invitation .
oh really ? she gave me mine earlier today .
well , she 'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .
yeah , so are you planning on going ?
i think so . it sounds like it 's going to be a lot of fun .
it really does , i ca n't wait .
what time does the party start ?
it starts at 8 o'clock .
oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?
i 'm not sure , but i do n't think she 's given out that many .
well , hopefully she 'll give me my invite later on today .
the outlook in the future is very positive . because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely .
as the department i am applying for is expanding , i would like to contribute by effort .
great . welcome to our company .
can you please tell me where you are located ?
sure , we are off singing road , close to the bank .
thank you , i know where that is .
hello , john .
i 'm with hartford public relations . i 'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
how about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?
oh , do n't mention it . it was terrible .
what ' the matter ?
the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone .
i see . you simply ca n't blame the server for this .
yes , i know . fast food is so popular in this district .
that 's true .
anyway , how was your such , catherine ?
it was good . i brought lunch from home today .
you did ? i thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america .
well , i personally do n't like them because i do n't believe that they are healthy .
i guess you 're right . more often than not , people go there only for convenience . the foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
yes . i am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , do n't you ?
you bet . almost all top brands such as mcdonald 's and kfc are from america .
well , actually two-thirds of americans may avoid these places .
seriously ?
yeah , it 's hard to believe but true .
wow , that 's really interesting . so who won ?
well , the great wall of china , the taj mahal in india .
i 've been there ! it really is an amazing work of architecture and art . the entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !
cool ! also amongst the winners is petra , in jordan , mach pitch in peru and the pyramid in chichenitza in mexico .
wait a minute ! it also says that the christ re-deemer statue in brazil and the colosseum in rome are wonders . i would love to go to italy and see the colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !
well , let 's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .
good idea !
that should be no problem . may i have your full name , please ?
my name is john sandals .
hello , mr . sandals . my name is michelle . what days do you need that reservation , sir ?
i 'm planning to visit new york from friday , april 14 until monday , april 17 .
our room rates recently went up . is that okay with you , mr . sandals ?
how much per night are we talking about ?
each night will be $ 308 .
that price is perfectly acceptable .
wonderful ! do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
nonsmoking , please .
next question , is a queen-size bed okay ?
that sounds fine .
okay , mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
certainly . my phone number is 626-555-1739 .
thank you , mr . sandals . we look forward to seeing you in new york !
um yes . i 'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese .
we have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.would you like a large pizza instead ?
sure , that sounds good .
great ! would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
no , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . oh , and make it thin crust .
okay , thin crust . your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free !
perfect . thank you . bye ..
wait ! ! i need your address !
hi there . i 'm calling about personal internet banking , what details can you give me ?
personal internet banking is a self service financial service that is based on the internet . it can be used by both businesses and individuals . we offer an online payment service , personal net banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . you can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ...
that sounds good . at the moment i spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .
it depends on the time of year . at peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . we also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . we run a very tight operation !
do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?
sometimes we use a local employment agency . it depends on the job .
well i think i can afford that apartment . but are pets allowed ?
hmm ... let me look . yes , it says it 's a pet-friendly building .
that 's great . that means i can bring my cat , mr . twinkles . where is the apartment located ?
it says it 's located in the suburbs .
chicken , please .
good choice !
what kind of drinks do you have ?
well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .
in that case , let me have a glass of orange juice .
anything else ?
i would like to have some tea as well .
another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .
i see .
i 'd be glad to .
i 'm afraid that i do n't have a credit history . i just came to this country .
do you have an account with this bank ?
i 'm afraid not .
in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . that would help with your credit card application .
what is the interest rate on your card ?
the annual charge rate is 9.5 % .
that 's very expensive !
not really . the credit card is a revolving account . you only pay interest on what you owe .
how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
does the card provide any other benefits ?
you can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card .
well , i almost always get up very early , and i lift weights for an hour .
you 're kidding !
no . and then i often go rollerblading .
wow ! how often do you exercise like that ?
about five times a week . what about you ?
oh , i hardly ever exercise . i usually just watch tv in my free time . i guess i 'm a real couch potato !
no , i do n't think we have .
my name is gao run .
how do you do ? my name is james green .
here 's my name card .
and here 's mine .
it 's nice to finally meet you .
and i 'm glad to meet you , too .
mr . smith , please .
sorry , he is out .
what time do you expect him back then ?
sorry , i am not sure . can i take a message ?
no , thanks . i will call back later .
that ’ s fine . please call again later .
ok . thank you . goodbye .
yes , i need some traveler 's checks .
how much do you need ?
three thousand us dollars .
all right , can i have your passbook ?
yes , here you go .
what amounts do you want the checks in ?
it 's all the same to me .
here you are .
thanks .
i need you to tell me what the problem is .
the bathroom sink is stopped up .
is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
are you going to be home so i can come by and take a look at the problem ?
i am not sure if i will be home later .
i will be coming by around 10 this morning . if you aren ’ t there , i ’ ll just use my key .
it 's more violent than tv news !
what time is it anyway ?
nine-thirty .
oh , my god , three hours already ! i have to get the chores done !
no time . that 's their headlights in the window !
ok , emergency measures . let 's throw the dishes in the trash ! two birds with one stone ...
little dude , your life is over !
no time to worry . we have to dispose of this evidence .
he 's 21 . how old is james ?
he 's a year older than keith , but he looks younger .
how 's your father ?
he 's fine . he retired last week . it 's a turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
oh , i do n't think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way , probably .
sure , let me take a look ... personal information , education , experience , training ... i think you should add another section for language . you speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .
but languages do n't have anything to do with engineering . should n't everything i put on my resume have something to do with my field ?
not necessarily . i think people would be impressed by your language abilities . it says something about your level of intellect and experience . also , i think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .
it 's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if i am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?
well , you 're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . that 's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they ca n't see from a piece of paper . but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
i need to think it over .
tell me what you need .
all right . i 'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable .
what a beautiful view we have here .
yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city .
wonderful . will we have any free time there ?
of course . we will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .
i ’ m fine , thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here .
that ’ s for sure . you ’ re new , too , huh ?
yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago . how about you ?
gave me the receipt , please .
here is my receipt .
what 's wrong with it ?
it 's too small for me to wear .
would you like another bigger one ?
no thanks . i want to have a refund .
ok , here is your money .
what is your favorite color , miss ?
red .
here you are.it ' s very attractive .
may i try it on ?
go ahead .
is there a mirror around here ?
right over there .
does it suit me ?
yes , you look very nice .
how much is it ?
we 're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
that 's quite reasonable .
may i ask you something ?
what 's your question ?
how many hours behind the wheel do i need ?
what do you need to take it for ?
i 'm trying to get my license .
you need six hours .
can i do all six hours in one day ?
you have to do it in three days .
that 's all i have to do ?
that 's everything .
well , that 's a relief .
yes ? i 'll be very glad if i could be of any help to you .
an hour ago , i bought this vase with my tourist .
oh , yes . i remember it clearly . is there anything wrong with it ?
i 'm afraid so . we found this crack on the bottom when i went back to my hotel .
oh , how awful ! let me have a look , i 'm terribly sorry . it was most thoughtless of me . would you excuse me , please ?
oh , it 's quite all right , i suppose . it ca n't be helped sometimes .
it 's very kind of you to say so . how about changing another one for you ?
all right . thank you .
just a minute , please . i wo n't be long . i 'm sure this one is perfect . you may examine it carefully .
oh , yes , it is . i 'll take this one .
i 'm very sorry for any inconvenience i 've caused you .
well , there 's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
sorry . i was too worried .
i firmly believe that you love your brother very much .
absolutely . by the way , do you sell any traditional chinese medicine ?
yes , we have some chinese medicine for common cold .
i heard chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
it depends . it 's true that you can take some for prevention .
it should be close to the university . neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
absolutely . that 's the most important thing to take into consideration . i 'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we 'll get a bigger one if it 's not expensive . do you mind if it 's in a noisy area ?
i do n't mind . i 'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
good point . ok , let 's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
yes , if we 're lucky we 'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
how much do you think the rent will be ?
i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
which tooth is it ?
this one here .
ar , yes . there ’ s a big cavity .
can you fill it ?
i ’ m afraid not . the tooth is too far gone . it 'll have to be taken out .
then i might as well have it done now .
you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . take the medicine i prescribe and come back in three days .
the local newspaper has ads for housing .
is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?
sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
what do landlords charge for rent ?
would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?
there are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment .
you should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .
i really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .
sure , i ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want .
with pleasure .
i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
no problem .
unfortunately , it 's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .
why is the price so high ?
it 's not just that the price is high , it 's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .
model of computers are n't compatible ?
most current computer systems simply ca n't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
but by then , the technology will be outdated .
true , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
that 's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
this model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it 's a top-quality product .
i guess you get what you pay for .
what kinds do you have ?
oh , yeah , it ’ s quite of variety . regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form .
last time i tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . set the wave a little loose than as usual , please .
i 'm sorry , sir . i 'm not sure i understand .
i 'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
oh , i see . so , you 're saying that you 've already run out of your amenities .
no , no . i 've got plenty left .
now i 'm confused again ! what is the problem ?
what am i going to do about souvenirs ?
oh , i get it ! you want souvenirs !
yes , i 've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
please ! free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
i understand completely , sir . housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
what 'd you like , madam ?
two muffins and a cup of coffee.will it take long ?
no , just a few minutes .
i ’ m doing well .
how may i help you ?
could you cancel a check for me ?
what ’ s the problem ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
how much ?
i wrote the check out for $ 150 .
what were you supposed to write it out for ?
i was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
i ’ ll just cancel it for you right now .
that ’ s great . you ’ re a lifesaver .
yes , madam . the reporting desk for the british airway 's flight to london is over there .
thank you so much . is this the desk for ba flight 123 to london ?
yes , this is the right desk . have you any luggage ?
the suitcase , that ’ s all . except my handbag . of course .
would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? you needn ’ t weigh your handbag .
is there a receipt ?
yes . i ’ ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket .
what must i do next ?
you must go to immigration to the departure lounge .
but i 'm not sleepy , mum . can i stay and watch more tv ?
it 's already half past eleven . you have school tomorrow . you 'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you do n't sleep well tonight .
i know . but i promise i wo n't be sleepy tomorrow . i work really hard .
do n't you have the exams coming up soon ? i 'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
oh , i nearly forgot the exams .
you do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . am i right ?
yeah , i guess so . maybe i can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
an excellent idea . work now and play later .
i know you 're right . school is more important than tv . can i watch one more show , then go to bed .
no , now it 's bedtime .
oh , yes , please . but you are just closing , are n't you ?
well , yes , we are , madam . the shop shuts down in five minutes .
i shall not keep you long then . it was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
last week , madam ? i really ca n't remember which ones you mean . what were they like ?
oh , they were lovely . sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if i remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
that 's strange . i do n't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . are you sure they were in this shop ?
oh , you must know the ones i mean . they were on sale , a real bargain . reduced to a quarter of the original price . i could n't believe my eyes when i saw them .
i am afraid the sales are over now , madam . and you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
i do n't think you did , you know . my neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
well , it 's all new stock in the window now .
may i just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?
eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
yes , yes , i am sorry i wo n't keep you . it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . but they were such beautiful saucepans . i ’ d have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot .
perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , i could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . and there are still one or two things at the sale price .
oh , look ! that was the one there . that is the sort of thing i was looking for . but it 's not quite the color .
that might be the artificial lighting , madam . of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for .
there it is . that is the pattern ! the set behind you . thank goodness , they have n't been sold . and thank you so much for being so patient with me . yes , those are the ones .
we have the offer ready for you . let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in june . the offer is valid for five days .
i can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
i am afraid i ca n't agree with you there . i must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we 've received from other companies .
but you must take the design and quality into consideration . you know we are superior to others in design and quality . we have various styles , which the other companies can not catch up with .
i agree that yours are of the top .
well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
impossible . how about 5 % off ?
right . a reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
four is an unlucky number here , peter.four sounds like death in chinese.hotels often have no fourth floor .
i see.oh , i know what i wanted to ask.how much should i tip this guy ?
people do n't usually tip here , but you can.fifty dollars should be more enough .
i ’ d like to make a reservation for my trip from detroit to beijing on april 13 on trans pacific airline .
do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket ?
i ’ d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return .
economy or business class ?
economy , please . how much is it ?
it will be $ 850 .
very good . could i get an electronic ticket ? i ’ m always afraid of losing my tickets .
no problem . how do you wish to pay for it ?
bank of american card . the number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 .
thank you ! would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ?
an aisle seat , please . i ’ m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often .
no problem . your ticket is for trans pacific flight 87 from detroit to beijing at 3 forty p . m . on april 13 . you will arrive at beijing international airport at six 35 p . m . on april 14 . your electronic
what time should i arrive at detroit airport ?
please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . you also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .
what happens if i can ’ t leave on april 13 ? can i cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?
yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
that ’ s ok . what are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?
on trans pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .
that ’ s great ! i can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . i think i ’ m all set . you ’ re really efficient . thank you very much for your help .
thank you for the compliment and for calling g . o . t . travel agency . have a nice trip !
well , i ’ ll be glad to help you out . i can come out anytime on tuesday or thursday of next week .
let ’ s put it down for 1:15 on thursday . we ’ ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
fine . i ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on thursday .
thank you.but it is too bright for me .
how about this brown one ?
let me try it on . i like that color .
ok , i will get one for your.here you are .
but it is too loose.do you have the smaller size ?
sorry , it had been sold out .
what a pity !
how much would you like to borrow ?
a thousand dollars .
let me check with a credit manager . a record show your credit reading is quite high . i do n't think you have any problems .
what ’ s the current interest rate ?
our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . would you please fill out the application the form ?
when you flip the tie up , he 's right side up . brilliant .
my dad will love this . he 's a dilbert fan .
i would n't mind having one myself ...
model it for me .
ok !
wow ! you look just as dorky as dilbert !
i hope you can give me some advice . i 'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . it 's such a long way from my home , but i checked and you are my nearest branch . is there anyway i can do it from home ?
that 's terrible . unfortunately , we do n't have that many branches outside the centre of town . what i 'd advise you to do is set up a direct debit service .
a direct debit service ? what 's that exactly ?
a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean , i receive my bills , not you .
we set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
i see . so , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? that does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
hi . it ’ s tony calling from the dentist ’ s office . is lily there ?
no , lily is not here at the moment .
could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?
sure . what ’ s your number , please .
519 367 8901 .
thanks . and your name is tony , right ?
yes . i ’ m tony . thank you very much .
you ’ re welcome . bye .
bye .
i think it 's great ! i really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . i 've actually been eyeing that dress at maxine 's for a while now , but i was n't sure i could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
um , ninety-five dollars ?
yes , that 's the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why , how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at helen 's boutique . i did n't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
of course ! everything at helen 's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why did n't you shop around ?
i do n't know , i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it . i guess i was too impulsive .
i did . why ?
did n't you know dogs should n't eat cooked chicken bones because they 're bad for their stomachs ?
no , i did n't . i 'm sorry . it wo n't happen again .
no , i do n't suppose he 's to blame.the man in the other car made a mistake .
but he 's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .
how to adjust ?
exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes .
ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas .
that 's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .
yes , sometimes the differences are great .
well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .
we have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
watch your language .
$ 10 per person .
here are $ 30 . by the way , where can i find a guide ?
turn to the next window and they will help you find one .
thanks a lot .
where are you heading now ?
i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road.it is very close to your house .
is that the university next to the teachers ' college ?
that 's the one .
you mean we 'll share the taxi ?
yeah.if we share the cab , it 'll be cheaper.besides that your chinese is better than mine.the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully .
well.don ' t worry about it , i will be happy to share the taxi with you .
my name is liu lichi . how do you do ?
how do you do ? please be seated , how is your trip here ?
quite good , i think . i came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
oh , yes.how old are you ?
twenty .
hum , still a student ?
yes , i 'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
what subjects are you studying ?
english , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
have you had any working experience .
well , i worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
what do you like to do in your spare time ?
i like sports very much.besides that , i also like working on a computer in my spare time .
how are your english and computer skills ?
i have passed the cet - 4 and 6.as far as computer is concerned i can use the computer for word processing .
okay . mr.liu , we 'll inform you of the results within a week .
it ’ s too loud .
we ’ ve been looking around for many hours.what on earth are you looking for ?
well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me .
what style do you want ?
i want to buy a v-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
oh , i see.how about the color ?
quiet color .
i know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
really ? let ’ s go there .
sure ! what do you feel like having ?
i really feel like having a big juicy steak !
oh . ok . i do n't eat meat , but that 's fine , i am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
i did n't know you were a vegetarian !
i 'm not , i am a vegan .
a what ?
a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you do n't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
wow ! that 's interesting ! it must be tough !
it 's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it 's getting a bit less difficult .
it was n't all that great .
what did you dislike the most ?
i do n't think that they had their act together . they did n't seem well prepared .
did you think that the food was any good ?
i was n't all that impressed by the food .
the service certainly could have been better .
the service did not help the situation .
is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?
i am not interested in trying this restaurant again .
no . i am a transit passenger going to sweden .
how long are you going to stay here ?
only one night .
do you have any dutiable items ?
no , i do n't .
what are these ?
they are my personal effects .
first of all , we need to understand what i was looking for . do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?
i am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
i went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in .
wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ?
sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of .
can i require the owners to fix the problems ?
you can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .
what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
there were no major problems . one leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that i found .
i will take a rain check .
tell me what seems to be the problem .
my roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . they stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while i have no place for study . i even do n't have the quietness to sleep .
did you ever talk to him about it ?
i have a question .
what do you need to know ?
i need to take the driver 's course . how many hours do i need ?
it depends on what you 're trying to do with the completion of the course .
i need to get my license .
you 're going to need to complete six hours .
how many hours a day can i do ?
you can do two hours a day for three days .
that 's all i need to do to finish ?
yes , that 's all you need to do .
thanks . i 'll get back to you .
yes , please .
ok . i 'll get the bellman to taka them up . which bags are yours ?
my luggage is in the corner over there . they are the leather suitcase , the canvass holdall and the blue backpack .
ok .
please be careful with the suitcase , it 's very heavy .
i 'll let the bellboy know . do n't worry , he 's very strong .
and the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .
of course .
wow ! it 's a fruit sculpture ! your chef is a real artist !
actually , uh , i made it myself ...
you did ? wow ! where did you learn ...
sorry , but i 've got ta run . enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
with the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we 'll inadvertently get inspired .
i guess this is a good excuse to surf the net on someone else 's dime .
who 'd have thought bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?
he must have just got online for the first time last week . he still thinks it 's some kind of new toy .
i 'm happy with that price .
let 's shake on it .
okay , let 's shake on it .
give me a big mac , a small order of french fries and a medium coke .
you 'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . they are still in the fryer .
that 's fine .
your total comes to $ 7 .
here 's a twenty . could you give me some more napkins ?
sure . your cash back is $ 13 . and we 'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
thanks .
miao ping , in your opinion , should we go for the type a or type b account ?
well , the type b account is very restricted . if your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your settlement account , i would recommend the type a account for you .
thanks for your time . i 'll go and discuss everything with my partner and i 'll be back later .
i 've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts .
it sounds like you 're coming down with something .
i 'll see what i have . what do you need it for ?
i want to get cigarettes .
you can use quarters , dimes and nickels .
may i see your ticket please ?
here you are . do you need to see my passport ?
any form of picture i . d . will do .
mmmm ... a photo i . d . i have my new jersey driver ’ s license . is that ok ?
that will do . what an interesting picture ! how old is it ?
actually it wad taken just last year , but i had a shaved head and a beard . can you still recognize me ?
barely . will you be checking any luggage today ?
yes , one suitcase . i also have a carry-on bag .
ok . mr . lee , you ’ re all set . your flight leaves from gate 10 . boarding begins at 10:30
we 'd better not move him . i 'll get the first-aider .
yeah , you know what ? i 've been going to the club regularly . the training really pays off . now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit .
really ? tell me about it . i have n't gone to the club for a long time . i am too busy with work .
it 's important to do proper exercises .
you 're right . too much or too little wo n't do any good .
the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
sounds reasonable .
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
and fruits !
surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
i 've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can also help one to keep sound physical health .
i think if you follow your trainer 's advice , you 'll be on the right track .
you bet it !
generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . we can vary the colors according to the buyer 's requirements . here are the catalogues and the pattern books . they will give you a rough idea about our products .
i am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . i think some of these items will find a ready market in canada . but what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product .
to be reliable is the strong point of our products . as a matter of fact , it 's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price .
then i 'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .
well , you know , the traffic in beijing is sometimes dangerous . therefore , i have to remind you of something . first , you should obey the traffic rules , do n't break in the red light . second , do n't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . finally , remember come on the left and go on the right !
oh , my dear sister , i am no longer a baby !
thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately .
that 's too bad . what problems are you having .
oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out , and i 'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . last week , i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ?
go right ahead .
well , i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room
wow , you really do have a talent for this , alice . thanks for the suggestions .
you are welcome , jack . glad to be of help .
nice to see you with us , anne.please make yourself at home .
thank you.you ' re so considerate .
there are different types . which one do you like best ?
i think the red one fits me well . can i try it on ?
surely , of course .
where is the fitting room ?
it 's there , near the mirror .
do n't worry . you 'll be fine . first of all , put on your seat belt . adjust the mirrors .
you do n't think i 'll need the seat belt , do you ?
of course not . but it 's a good habit to put it on every time you drive .
just in case , right ?
right . hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock .
i ’ m going to england by flight be987 .
when is your flight ?
10:00 am . when am i supposed to check in ?

what is your problem ?
my children can never be obedient even if i criticized them severely .
you need not always do that . why don ’ t you pat them on the back occasionally ?
sorry , sir . that table has been booked .

actually you can have a window seat if you do n't mind a ten-minute wait .
there is no need . thanks .

do n't make such a fuss . i 'm sure you will like today 's programme .
what 's on today ?
a basketball match between chinese team and american team .
really ? i 'm interested in it .
it might begin now .
did you send in your continued claim form for the last period ?
i think i forgot to send it in !
you need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid .
can i send it in now ?
you should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . if it hasn ’ t been , we will still accept it .
can i mail it in early next time so it isn ’ t late ?
actually , you can not mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
will my paycheck come right away now ?
your check will arrive a little late .
yes , i am .

three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .
like what ?
oh , he wanted to know what time i got up this morning and if i bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .
what on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?
i 've no idea . oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . he asked me what i had for breakfast this morning .

thank you . i 'm sure you will .
i hope so . thank you for saying so .
sure , what is the problem ?
i got poison oak while hiking , and i need something to help me with the itching .
i can suggest a product called techne that comes in a lotion or cream .
which do you prefer ?
hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
is there anything else i can do to help with the itching ?
you can take an antihistamine .
thank you so much for all of the information .
you are welcome . please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
yes , i would like to book a room for my wife and myself .

i do n't want to miss my flight .

thank you .
no ! my tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . now my engine is on fire !
i think that 's just steam . your engine 's overheated .
do you know a lot about cars ?
a little bit . i 'll take a look if you want me to .
please . thank you so much for stopping .
yeah , she 's hot . radiator 's leaking . looks like you were running her pretty hard .
that must have been just before i got the speeding ticket .
did you have an accident recently ... hey , wait a second ! i know this car !
you do ?
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name 's hal .
i 'm akimbo . nice to meet you , i guess .
boy , i 'm sure sorry about your car . hey , akimbo , i wonder if you 'd like to make a deal ?
what kind of deal ?
i 'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
you do n't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
i 'd rather not . they 'll raise my rates . it 'll cost me more in the long run .
if you give me cash , do you care if i do n't fix the car ?
hell , i do n't care . just do n't submit a report to your insurancecompany .
it 's a deal , hal . thanks again for stopping to help . and thanks for smashing my car !

i am sure you can do better than that .
sorry , sir . it 's the sale price .
well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
it 's my rock bottom price . take it or leave it .
i am afraid not . are there any vacant tables ?
i do n't think so . you have to wait for about 10 minutes .
that 's all right .
yes , what do you want to know ?
the information is scanty for me . and can you describe the responsibilities of the position ?
yes . copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company .
i 'd like to have it in big waves .
shall i put some oil on ? b
i 'm glad to see you !
sit down , please . maybe you have read the contract , but i want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . you must have a three-month internship .

i 'll pass on the soup , but i 'd like a garden salad .
can i get you anything to drink ? :
yes , i 'd like a glass of iced tea .
okay . i 'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
thank you .
i 'd love to .
first , put away your toys .
ok .
i 'll get the flour out .
let me help you .
thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
this is our rock-bottom price , and we ca n't make any further reduction .
if so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
then what ’ s your counter-offer ?
this is our counter-offer .
we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .
so are we . our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
how about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?
agreed .
i usually have cereal for breakfast .
but is n't it served with cold milk ?
yeah . cold milk wakes me up .
chinese people do n't like to eat cold food .
is that right ?
but i 'm open to new things . i 'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
with cold milk ?
with cold milk !
our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .
great ! how much per copy ?
sir , one copy is ten cents .
okay , i 'll be down there shortly .
you probably wo n't have to wait for anyone , sir .
yes . now we are in the olympic stadium , the center of this park .
splendid ! when is it gon na be finished ?
the whole stadium is to be finished this june .
how many seats are there in the stand ?
oh , there are 5000 seats in total .
i didn ’ t know it would be so big !
it is ! look there , those are the tracks . and the jumping pit is over there .
ah ... i see . hey , look the sign here , no climbing .
we put many signs with english translations for foreign visitors .
ok . well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .
i know , that 's my problem . what do you think i should do ?
well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .
oh , great idea !
well , i love it . the room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially , i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place !
that ’ s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
what was so bad about it ?
small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn ’ t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
totally agree . by the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
yes , that ’ s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english , and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 .
yes , i ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
yes that ’ s right . i ’ ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
well , it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ?
well i ’ ve always been keen on writing , so i became the editor for the university student magazine , which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter , to help the homeless in york .
what did that involve ?
providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
i ’ m sure . okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ?
yes , okay .
what would you like ?
twenties and some smaller bills , please .
anything else ?
yes . could you tell many balance ? here 's account number .
it 's nothing serious . but i always have a headache , and i have n't slept properly for several weeks . i 've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .
mm , you do look rather pale . let me take your temperature . would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? now , let me listen to your pulse . mm , do you feel weak ?
yes , i never seem to have any energy .
i 'll give you a blood test . would you roll up your sleeve ? just as i thought . you 're anemic . you 'd better pay more attention to your diet . eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . and do n't stay up late working . try to get more rest .
thank you .
do you have a map of the campus ?
yes , i have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . i ’ m not very good at reading maps .
do you know where your classes are ?
more or less . i go to three different buildings , and always get there late . i feel so hopeless . i don ’ t know why i am late all the time . no one else seems to be .
that 's because you do n't know the short cuts . you 'll learn them after a while . i can show you the ropes .
which train do you like ?
t112 to washington please .
may i have your name ?
that 's lincoln .
i can ’ t wait to vote .
who are you voting for ?
the person i ’ m voting for is the best .
what do you like about him ?
he is very intelligent .
you think so ?
that ’ s right . plus , i agree with his policies .
i ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited .
i ’ m voting for the next president .
i ’ m sure he will be .
i ’ m going to make sure and vote .
yes , i 'd like to check out now . my name 's adams , room 312 . here 's the key .
one moment , please , sir . ... here 's your bill . would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ?
what 's the 14 pounds for ?
that 's for the phone calls you made from your room .
can i pay with traveller 's cheques ?
certainly . may i have your passport , please ?
here you are .
could you sign each cheque here for me ?
sure .
here are your receipt and your change , sir . thank you .
thank you . goodbye .
i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.it ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because i move quickly and i am decisive .
what things impress you in your colleagues ?
i admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . i also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .
what are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
the only thing i really do n't like is to get feedback in front of others . i want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that i have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . i believe that 's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
how do you organize and plan for major projects ?
i love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.then , i set a timetable that 's realistic.what i usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because i 've already visualized what could happen and how i 'd react .
describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks.the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because i could't bring my office files with me.luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
how do you manage your time in a typical day ?
i 've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.the last thing i do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which i take care of at the end of the day or week .
describe a time when you acted on someone 's suggestion .
i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
yeah , i deleted all that superstitious crap . what a waste of bandwidth !
i figured i might as well send one or two of them out . maybe my luck will get better .
do you really think the dalai lama sent that ? i 'm tired of all these forwards .
it 's worth a shot . maybe we 'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
you are not late , mr . thomas . there 're still 15 minutes to go . mr . white has just called you .
what did he say ?
he said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming .
he should n't drive his car . he should come here by bus .
some what ?
some chinese food . i 'm hungry , and there 's a take-out restaurant near here . we can have them deliver and then watch the news on tv while we eat .
no , i 'd rather go out . the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home . maybe we can try some other food today ... what about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
okay . i could go for that . it 's called al 's steakhouse . they also have great fried fish , and i love their salad bar . you can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
yes , their steaks are enormous . sometimes i ca n't finish what i 've ordered .
what if that happens to me ? i hate to let food go to waste .
do n't worry . we 'll just get a doggie bag .
i know something about it . our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .
it takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so i can not bear it anymore . it is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills .
is that true ?
definitely !
if that information is exact , i guess our company is willing to promote someone .
i would like to buy some flowers , please . something really nice .
i see , may i ask what the occasion is ?
it ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like i ’ m sorry .
very well.this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
i think i ’ m gon na need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ?
mmm , well this is our i ’ m sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
i don ’ t think that ’ s gon na cut it . i need something bigger and better !
i ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
well , i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
get out of my store , you jerk !
i 'm very sorry , sir . i could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .
you mean like a bus ? have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
i have not sir . but i do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to chicago every hour from here .
alright , give me the number . but put me on that waiting list as well .
here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
how many people are on the waiting list right now ?
right now i show that there are 176 people on the list . and you are number 176 .
i do n't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.if the problem is resources , share them .
it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it 's harder to make peace between countries .
yes , it is.one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
i ’ m sorry , mr . myers . i ’ ve just been so busy today .
i really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , janet . we ’ re running a busy office here . you ’ re going to have to keep up .
you ’ re right , sir . i apologize . i ’ ll get those files for you now .
i prefer a sedentary job and i used to work as an operator .
we need an operator now .
it 's just the job i 've been searching for .
i know . it really makes a mess of the whole election process .
and it takes up all the news .
the problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
it 's so small . the fact that there is public interest , does n't say much for us as the public .
have you ever listened to am radio ? it 's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on tv and fm radio .
i do n't remember the last time i listened to am radio .
another place you can get real insight is european papers . you can get them on-line .
i can check that for you right now . would you mind holding ?
sure . no problem .
mr . robson , i 'm sorry . our computer system is down . could i call you back later ?
sure . do you have my number ?
yes , i have it right here . i 'm so sorry about this .
no problem . i 'll wait for your call .
i 'm working on my resume .
really ? did you find any information about a new job ?
yeah , i just got some good information off the internet .
great ! do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
i didn ’ t just find out about one job . there were several ones that looked good .
maybe i should try looking on the web for work .
sure you have to be patient . but i think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . you might have no chance .
how do you know if you don ’ t have a try ?
is this the one you want ?
no , the one next to it .
here you are .
thanks . what kind of stone is this ?
it 's a ruby . it is from south africa . would you like to try it on ?
yes , please . how much is it ?
it costs $ 200 .
it looks good . ok . i 'll take it .
thank you , lisa .
here is a present for you . i hope you like it .
oh , great ! i love it ! you know i 've been expecting this for a long time .
i 'm very glad to hear that .
come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
i 'm not sure , i feel hot and cold .
when did the trouble start ?
i was sick most of the night .
it sounds like you are coming down with the flu . let me take your temperature .
have i got a high fever ?
yes , thirty-eight point seven . do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
yes , i have .
now , let me have a look at you . i 'd like to listen to your chest . now breathe in , a deep breath , that 's it cough , now again . i want to examine your throat , too . open wide , say ' ah - - '
aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
yes , it does look a bit sore . let 's take an x-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
all right , thanks .
the tests showed nothing wrong . a slight viral infection .
what shall i do today ?
i 'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . take an aspirin when you 've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . drink plenty of water , then you 'll feel better . here 's the prescription .
you can be sure of that , sir .
thank you .
what did they say ?
they said i need a new hard drive .
that 's too bad . how much is a new one ?
it 's not too much , only about $ 85 .
plus installation ?
no , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
really ?
yes , it 's just a couple of screws .
that 's nice .
it 's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
if my hard drive crashes , i 'll just call you .
do n't get up so late next time . you should have gone to bed earlier last night .
yes , mum .
yes . i feel refreshed .
how long will we dock ?
in half an hour . the surface of the lake is calm .
yes . we come at the right time .
yes . i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ?
in my opinion , there are several places you must n't miss , like washington d . c , las vegas , new york and los angeles .
someone suggests that i should go to seattle and hawaii .
yes , you may consider those two places also . seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there 's a very famous museum called museum of flight .
and seattle is the home of microsoft and boeing . that must be a great place . i ca n't miss it .
you know , i fell in love with this house the first moment i laid eyes on it .
the style of the exterior is just what i ’ ve been looking for !
the exterior is only half of the story . the interior is incredible .
this home is gorgeous on the inside !
everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
the wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
i love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
the master suite is the best . let ’ s go look at that next .
there is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and i love the light in this room .
i know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
l am afraid there is n't any fancy soap in my room .
sorry sir , we will bring you one.anything else ?
yes.bring me a bath towel as well .
can i make a reservation for flight fw58 to san marino ?
sure . when do you want to take the plane ?
next monday .
will that be first class or economy seat ?
what 's the fare for a first class seat ?
$ 200 .
oh . i am not a wall streeter.give me an economy one please .
yes , hello again . i would like to know the exact difference between dividend deposit and dividend participated deposit .
that 's pretty easy to explain . with the deposit , the interest is fixed , but the dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . the longer the term , the higher the dividend you earn . this is because it is calculated at the compound interest rate .
and i can purchase that here ?
yes . and if you already have a current account with us , the insurance premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
that 's easy . it was your office ergonomics that decided me .
you 're kidding ! something as simple as that ?
yes . it is very important to me . my mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . i have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and i know that t
yes , there has been a lot of research into rsi 's . something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
yes , i noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
well , welcome to the team .
oh , thank you .
is there anything i can do for you now ?
yes . i 'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . please make the bed .
certainly , sir .
marry lin please .
sure , just a moment . ... i 'm sorry no one answer the phone .
all right , could i leave a message ?
certainly !
please ask her to call john .
well , that 's what i 'm looking for myself .
it 's very confusing in here , is n't it ?
absolutely . oh , do you see a sign there ?
it should be the way out .
ok . let 's go and see .
well , sir , i think i have made a mistake . i will take it back to the kitchen right now .
i think you should be more careful next time .
yes , sir . i 'm really so sorry about that .
look , sally . i ’ ve put just as much work into this as anybody else .
no , i ’ m sorry . i disagree . i don ’ t think you ’ ve been working at full speed at all .
well . i ’ m sorry you feel that way .
things are going good today . how have you been doing , mary ?
things are going well for me , joe .
want to go see a movie tonight ?
my parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
could you go with me to the movies on friday night , instead ?
what movie did you want to see ?
there is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
i was thinking that i would like to see “ the secret life of bees . ”
oh great ! sounds like something i need to bring kleenex to !
tired and stressed . this wedding is giving me a headache .
just relax . with me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !
i 'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
hey ! i 'm the tour guide . i 'll take care of the taiwanese guests .
you 're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
i will . do n't worry !
nothing , mummy . i was hungry so i came here for some milk .
milk ? i thought you did n't like milk .
i do n't , but i could n't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
nonsense . there 's lots of food in the refrigerator ... what 's behind your back ?
nothing .
what are you hiding behind your back ? let me see .
promise that you wo n't get angry .
ok , i promise . what is it ?
it 's a kitty .
oh , jim . i told you . no pets . it 'll make a mess of this house .
please , mummy . everybody else in my class keeps a pet . please , i 'll take care of it . it 's a good kitty . it 'll not bring you any trouble .
no way . it might belong to somebody else . you ca n't keep it here .
please , mummy . i found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . it was starving and looking for something to eat . please ! you see , it 's so cute and tame .
all right . but you have to clean up everything it messes up .
i will . thank you , mummy .
sure , anything you say .
actually , it ’ s a little bit silly .
don ’ t worry about it , just ask .
what words do i need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
you need to know the type of shoes you want .
don ’ t worry about that . i can point it out in the store .
the shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . in girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
let me write all that down . i ’ m going shopping this afternoon .
it has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .
so , it has a history for more than a decade ?
yes . and it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .
can you help me with comprehensive credit granting ?
certainly , madam . what would you like to know ?
well , everything really .
all right . we can grant a financing promise quota , if you qualify . this means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . firstly , your credit rating must be class a , and your debt to asset ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in .
all right . but i do n't want to play tennis . we played tennis last weekend .
okay . what do you want to do ?
i want to go jogging .
all right . that sounds like fun .
i am terribly sorry . you did n't come to reconfirm recently.you should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it 's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .
but i have been so busy all these days.well , is there any other ticket available ? i want the next one .
does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? the same is true in the west .
no , absolutely not ! on the contrary , you 'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . but always pay attention to what you say . if the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
you mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? that goes in like with confucius ' preachings , right ?
correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
yes , plenty of them . do n't eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
haha , i 'm afraid it 's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .
we will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? that will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . the office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .
you can double check with the housekeeping department , but i am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . they are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . as long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
ok , i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . is there anything else we need to order while i am at it ?
i think the only thing is toner . try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
ok , will do .
what size do you want ?
i wear size 40 .
how about this one ? it 's the latest design .
oh , i like the color .
i 'm looking for a pair of shoes .
what size do you wear ? these shoes are on sale .
i wear size 36.this pair looks nice.can i try them on ?
of course , yes.they look nice.and they 're not expensive .
how much are they ?
they are $ 168 .
i 'll take them .
i think it 's the postman.will you go and open the door ?
all right . i 'll get it .
no , we do n't .
how many of you , please ?
six , including two kids .
i 'm afraid all the big tables are taken .
if you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .
are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ?
i will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .
will i be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
how will i know what the numbers mean ?
you can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
how can i see test results from tests i have taken before ?
we put all of your test results up in the same place . just check the dates for what you need .
if that 's the case . there 's not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off .
what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . how about meeting each other halfway ?
what 's your proposal ?
your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . well , i suggest we meet each other halfway .
do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that 's impossible !
what would you suggest ?
the best we can do is another 30 dollars off . that 's definitely the lowest we can go .
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . let 's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
ok . we can meet halfway again .
good morning , ruth . did i wake you up ?
no , i was just about to get up . what 's up , carl ?
listen , i am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . are we supposed to meet at the chinatown terminal of the avenue b bus or d bus ?
b as in boy . you should get off at the last stop in chinatown .
oh , you mean canal street ?
that 's the wrong direction . canal street is on the other side of chinatown .
oh , i get it . when did we decide to meet ?
at 10,45 . is ann coming along ?
i can not get hold of her yet .
see you around , carl .
see you later .
yes , we have . we 've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards .
what about your use of raw materials ?
well , we 've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more .
what happens if you exceed the limits ?
we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .
that 's the best there is .
okay , i 'll take one .
that 'll be $ 200 , sir .
yes , please . we 're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . could you bring us some towels and hangers ?
no problem , sir . everything will be ready when you come back .
external factors . i think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors .
what are the internal factors that influence the company ?
the internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .
what words ? can you tell me ?
he says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if i do something that he doesn ’ t like . you know , if i wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
honey , i don ’ t know what to tell you . of course tony is a young child . but do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .
yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
i suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . if he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .
it ’ s easy to say , but i will try .
motivate tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .
i know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . but this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .
yes , i am james mason from anderson and associates . i would like to see mr . smith .
do you have an appointment ?
yes , he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .
i wonder if mr . smith forgot your meeting . i am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . will you please have a seat ?
sure .
yes , mr . mason , i just checked with our office manager , ms . terry , she said mr . smith briefed her on your project . she is just finishing up a meeting now . she could be with your shortly . would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
that would be very nice . thank you .
right this way , mr . mason . we can start with our front office . when ms . terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . there is a conference room already prepared
no , but i heard about that angelina jolie and brad pitt did n't attend .
yes , that was surprising . i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood .
they 're also one of the richest couples . they have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars .
did either one of them win an oscar this year ?
i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but i do n't think he won anything .
tom cruise may be handsome , but i think he 's a bit crazy , do n't you ?
yes , his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous .
i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i do n't know why they have to make it so complicated .
i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
that 's true . i guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
thank goodness we 're not rich and famous !
being famous , i can do without , but i would n't mind being rich .
could i purchase euro with rib here ? i have to stay here for months .
yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .
yes , i have known of it .
how much do you like to exchange ?
20,000 rib .
in what denominations ?
it does n't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .
right , i will exchange for you now . please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .
well , could you change them too ? the dollars , i want to change them into swiss francs .
ok , wait for a moment . well , i am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . in this case , you 'd better change 2,000 $ to swiss francs .
it does n't matter .
please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .
thanks a lot . good-bye .
we 'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .
that would be nice . how are you getting there ?
well , i prefer to go on the train , but i suppose you want me to take the car .
oh , i much prefer to go by car , then we do n't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...
and i 've got to drive . you know i 'm not fond of that . i found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
which is more expensive ?
but very much quicker . but i know we 'll never agree on this subject . you prefer the car . i prefer the train .
now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?
what a wonderful neighborhood ! can you find that house on our open house list ?
yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .
they always make the front yards look so great for open houses . let ’ s see what the inside looks like .
i am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .
signing the registry is a good idea . i think i want to see the kitchen next .
i really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .
i need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it .
is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?
the asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars .
oh , madam , buy what ?
a new car . and i 've got a small family , two children , and i have n't got a lot of money and ...
oh , oh , madam , madam , i 'm afraid you have the wrong number .
is n't this the car store ?
no . it 's mike 's sporting goods .
oh , sorry . do you know the number for a car store , then ?
no . i do n't . i suggest you look in the phone book .
i 'm sorry to have bothered you .
no problem .
what day was your appointment on ?
my appointment was on monday .
what time had you chosen ?
it was for 10
i am looking at your appointment right now . what day would you prefer ?
i would prefer next thursday .
what time would be best for you ?
i want to come in at 2
i am writing you down for that time . we look forward to seeing you .
hi , robert . this is janet reese calling from american advertising . we placed an order with you about a week ago .
yes , ms . reese . i remember , you spoke with me . is there a problem ?
well , it still hasn ’ t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it .
that 's so great !
how much are you selling it for ?
this t . v is only $ 2500 .
you ca n't be serious .
that 's how much this t . v costs .
that 's too expensive for me .
this television is of very high quality .
you ca n't go down on the price .
by how much ?
i 'll buy it for $ 2000 .
i 'm sorry , but the price is final .
yes , i packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession .
are you bringing in any plants or animal products ?
no .
our sniffer dog seems to disagree . do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
not at all . go right ahead .
what ’ s this sir ?
it ’ s traditional chinese medicine . i mix it with hot water like tea . sorry . i forgot about it .
what are these red things sir ?
oh no ! i forgot about those too ! those are chinese sausages for my aunt lily .
i ’ m sorry sir , but you can ’ t take any of this into the country . we will also have to check your carry-on . please step this way . don ’ t ’ be nervous ; we ’ ll just look through it briefly and then
hold on a second please . i 'm sorry . he has gone out .
oh.this is paul.when will he be back ?
he will be back at about seven o'clock .
can i leave a message please ?
yes , certainly .
please tell him i 'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
all right . i 'll tell him when he comes back .
thank you very much .
not yet , but i 'm thinking of it . have you bought one , dad ?
i took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary .
can you tell me why you want to buy it ?
i am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . i have to consider your mother 's life .
oh , i see . do you advise me to buy one ?
you have children now . what if something , god forbid , happens to you ?
that 's true . well , how much do you think i should get ?
a $ 100 000 policy should n't be too expensive . here , call my agent . he 'll give you a good deal .
yes , i do , susan . just a moment . here it is .
thank you , sir . sorry to trouble you .
not at all , susan . just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ’ s finished with it
i 'm going to the hospital to see susan .
i saw her yesterday.she was a little better .
must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
no , you need n't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
number 13 buses run much more frequently , do n't they ?
yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said i had taken a wrong bus .
thank you , henry . i 'll get a number 13 .
but number 13 buses leave from the center of town.you ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
here you are .
ah , thank you.please bring your luggage here for inspection .
ok.but is there anything wrong ?
it 's just a regular inspection . do you have anything to declare ?
i 've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.besides , i have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift .
well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . but according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.you ' ll have to pay duty for the other one .
ok . where shall i pay duty for it ?
please wait a minute . i 'll make out the duty memo ... here you are.take this and pay to the woman over there .
i 've paid for it . here 's the receipt .
very well . i hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in america .
thank you .
nice to see you , too . i heard you are a staff of nokia company .
yes , i ’ m satisfied with this job .
congratulations . what did you do during the interview ?
pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .
how can i have the good external expressions ?
don ’ t worry about that . you just pay more attention to the details of people ’ s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language .

no , no way ! what happened ? give me my money !
danger , danger ! the exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive . thank you for using our bank . have a nice day .
i am great ! how about you , mary ? how are you ?
i am doing great ! thank you for asking , joe .
i was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?
i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
ok . what about going to the movies on friday night ?
what were you planning on seeing ?
i was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
how about “ the secret life of bees ” ?
that 's a chick flick !
first , i 'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . he or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
that ’ s very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we ’ ll need someone to hire staff .
i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that . i don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . have we decide on the location of
yes . we have . we chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd .
why didn ’ t we choose an office in the cbd ?
the offices there were too expensive . have we negotiated any contracts yet ?
yes . we ’ ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . we hope to sign another three this month .
when will the branch office open ?
hopefully next month . everything is a little rushed . we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
has and advertising campaign been prepared ?
yes , it has . we ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines .
i made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . we should be able to get plenty of customers .
i want to pick up my valuables .
may i have your key please ?
sure . here you are .
here is your valuable . is that right ?
yes , thank you .
why ? i thought americans were supposed to be more open than that .
well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
do you think most people in america believe that abortion is wrong ?
no , i think it 's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
it 's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america .
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
what do you think about abortion ?
i personally would never want to have one , but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman 's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
i know this is going to sound sexist , but i do n't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
why not ? it 's their children , too .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
that might be true , but i think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
but i do n't have any reading assignments .
then review for your test . you 'll do even better . and maybe reading will help you get to sleep .
aw , mom-you 're such a drag .
you say that now , lily , but you 'll thank me later . i 'm your mom , and mother knows best .
sorry , we have n't made the decision at all .
do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ?
we will let you know probably next monday . i hope to give you a positive reply .
i 'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .
you can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing .
what if i need a roommate ?
there are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
how much do apartments cost around here ?
it depends on what you want . do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
i just need a one-bedroom apartment .
that will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
would you come with me to look at apartments ?
i would be happy to look at apartments with you .
heard what ?
deborah already had her baby .
i did n't know that .
i thought you knew .
i honestly did n't know .
the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
that 's good to hear .
will you go and visit them ?
of course i will .
i just wanted to give you the good news .
thanks for letting me know .
but that was the first thing that came into my mind when i heard the shout earthquake !
why not use staircases ? the terror was not so violent at that time .
that would be too late .
maybe the situation is too urgent .
yes , i think i should have jumped in any case .
i know what you mean . i 've started eating better myself .
what foods do you eat now ?
i tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
those are the only things you eat ?
that 's basically what i eat .
why are n't you eating anything else ?
well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
and the chicken ?
it 's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
i guess that does sound a lot healthier .
good morning ! welcome to our office !
nice to meet you ! my name is grace williams .
nice to meet you too ! i am peter smith .
today is my first day at work !
well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! just ask me if you need any help .
thank you . it 's very kind of you .
you are welcome .
yes , i used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
what were you mean duties there ?
i mostly did advertising planning .
what qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
what was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities . advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . if i want to make in marking in advertising industry , i can ’ t stop studying and creating .
no , i do n't .
shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
that sounds like a good idea .
i know a very interesting place .
oh , do you ? good .
i 'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul , but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before , has n't he ?
yeah , a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok , let 's go in , sandy .
it 's not even noon yet .
that means it will get hotter .
i am dying from the heat .
turn on the air conditioner .
it does n't work .
what happened ?
i do n't know .
did you call the repairman ?
of course .
when is he coming ?
he 's busy . he said next week .
yes , thank you . i 've already been helping myself .
this dish taste terrific . would you like to try a little ? it is a little hot , but very good .
i like hot food , especially sichuan cuisine .
would you like another beer ?
i 'll have another cup of beer insist . i know i do n't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
come on , it 's the weekend . let 's taste and enjoy this meal . cheers !
bottom 's up , and you 're right . this meal is incredible . i wish i had known this restaurant before . thanks for bringing me here . i know i 'll be back agile soon .
well , i must apologize , madam . we have new computers here , you know .
do n't you think it 's about time you got them working properly ?
i agree entirely . i assure you it wo n't happen again .
oh , yes , i am . i have always wanted to go to the states . i love meeting new people . and making new friends .
well , i 'm sure you will .
well , there 's one thing .
what 's the matter
i 'm a little worried about my host family . you know , in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
swimming in summer and skating in winter.what ' s your favorite sport ?
jogging and bowling . do you know how to practise bungfu ?
no i do n't but l do taijiquan or shadow boxing.people everywhere in china usually do taijiquan early in the morning.it can help people keep fit.it has a history of over three hundred years .
is it easy to learn ?
yes . it is i can teach you if you like .
thank you . i can teach you how to bowl .
right . let 's help each other .
i 'm not certain . do you know ?
america was discovered by christopher columbus in 1492 .
in a way that 's right . but the vikings travelled there long beforecolumbus . and what about the red indians ?
all right . ask me a question now .
who invented the electric light bulb ?
that 's easy . it was invented by edison .
correct . now for a harder question . who will be the first men on mars ?
i ca n't answer that . but i think mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
ask me a question now .
all right . what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
that 's easy . it 's .. er . venus . no . pluto . no . wait a minute . it 's anthe tip of my tongue . oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
you bought a compact car ?
no , i borrowed it .
let me guess , from sarah . it looks like something she would drive .
you guessed right . besides , the color violet is a little girly for me .
i love it . it 's so festive ! and where did you get that cup ? it 's got the same logo .
terrible ! does he want to divorce ?
i am not sure .
don ’ t lose your reason . go to find him and talk with him .
you have much patience .
wow ! your calligraphy is very beautiful . it was worth the wait !
thank you . today i 'm writing a kind of poem called a chinese couplet .
what does it say ?
this is an especially famous one . it says `` may the passing days bring you health and longevity . may this season of renewal find you basked in riches . ``
that 's very nice . is it for sale ?
no . i never sell my artwork .
really ? then what do you do with it ?
i give it away . here , this one is for you .
wow ! really ? are you sure ? now i 'll have a lucky year !
remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it can not be given or taken away ...
very romantic ?
yeah . he always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .
you married him for that reason ?
definitely not . the most important thing was we loved each other .
yeah , some places are very short of water .
because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
you see , this time i traveled to the west . when i looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that i could see are as dry as a bone .
it is serious .
me too .
she does have a heart of gold .
you can say that again .
you do n't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ?
well , i have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
of course it does ! they tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . i think most of the times they are just scam artists .
well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
yes , i 'd like a book about law .
would you tell me the name of the book and the author ?
uh , the origin of law . and it 's written by professor felix of harvard .
i 'm sorry . it 's out of stock now . could you come by again next week ?
next week ? it is too late . i need it urgently .
well , then , is it convenient to leave your phone number so that i can inform you as soon as we restock it ?
no , thanks any way .
you 're welcome .
anne ! i have n't seen you for ages.how ' ve you been ?
fine , just fine.and you ?
not bad.it really is great to see you again.where have you been ?
guangzhou . i 've got a cousin there .
what 's up , robert ?
cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... i ca n't keep them all straight !
slow down . what are you talking about ?
it 's about a girl . no , an angel ! i 'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
yes , may i help you ?
we have just arrived from tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . all of above , we can not find it .
what is your reservation number ?
our reservation number is j - 221 .
let me see . oh , yes , we have your reservation number .
you mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ?
i ’ m sorry to say no .
here i ’ ll take taxi instead , how do you refund us ?
i do n't know . it 's a rental .
i will give you premium unleaded . alright ?
sure , why not ?
that is the pump you are in front of .
is it expensive ?
it is the most expensive .
well , i do n't want it then . can i move to another pump ?
yes , i can give you regular unleaded . but you have to back up the car a little .
give me regular unleaded then . i will back up.can you wash my windows for me ?
i 'm sorry , sir . this is not a full service gas station . i will help you fill the gas , but we do n't wash windows here .
really ? well , i guess i have to get used to it .
josh and i were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we 'd drop by .
i am so glad that you decided to stop by !
yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
mary , can i get josh or you something to drink ?
oh no , thank you . we are n't all that thirsty .
how about a little snack then ?
no , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
well then , how is your family ?
everyone is doing great . my sister finally had her baby .
each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .
oooh ! one for each of the zeros in 2000 ! wow !
stop making fun of me .
so find a guy to marry and you can get one !
i do n't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !
oh , i see . you 're going to wear one and pretend you 're married to try to attract guys .
congratulation . what will you do ?
they got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an australian businessman chinese .
that 's wonderful . i want to get a part-time job too . tell me what i should do .
it 's very simple actually . you can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . they will give you a call if any job comes up .
good . i 'll do it .
only once or twice at the most .
do you know why ?
i have no idea .
you can have a bird view of guiling city from the top of the mountain .
wonderful ! i 'll often come here for mountain climbing .
you should . many guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
no wonder people say
quick ! pass me your binoculars . look at that bird ... i 've never seen one of those before . it 's indigenous to guiling , and an endangered species too . this is lucky !
i did n't know you liked bird-watching .
i do n't really . i just like wildlife , and you do n't get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it .
aw , that 's sweet ! i knew your costume would be a success .
it 's a success all right . the kids keep trying to catch me .
yeah , i saw that . i thought you were playing a game with them .
some game ! you try being tackled by ten kids at once !
um , holly ? look behind you . they 're coming this way .
of course i 'd come . i could n't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .
yeah . it 's hard to believe that it 's been ten years since graduation . it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
how time flies . but hey , how are things going with you ?
oh , where to start ? there have been ups and downs . i 'm still trying to find my place in this world . it 's only recently that i 've been able to start settling down . how about you ? you still with jenn
yeah , jenny and i got married right after graduation . it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . i was supporting us both while she continued her studies . but now things are getting better
oh , that sounds wonderful . i have always known you two would make it . i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys . i do n't want us to drift apart again .
definitely ! actually , we just moved into a new place . there 's a house-warming party this saturday , if you are free ? i know jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
sounds great ! i 'll be there .
all set . i 've got my makeup , my cds , and my portable tv set ...
hello ! we 're supposed to be getting back to nature .
yeah , yeah . anyway ... i 'm packed . are you ?
i 've been packed for a week . all my stuff is in this backpack .
let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
that 's trail mix !
same difference . what 's this ?
i hope we 'll get together again soon .
i hope so . a good journey to you !
thank you .
why do you say so ? everyone admires that you have a good wife .
oh , no . when we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . it was a hard time .
but now you are rich .
and we have some squabbles on some boring things .
this is ordinary marriage life .
don ’ t be kidding , ok ?
what ’ s the matter ? so angry . i ’ m just playing a joke with you .
because i have given him up as a bad job . our relation has been over .
yes , i think so , if you want to graduated this year , you 've got to take a science course .
right , i figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
well , i have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
yes , i really weak in maps , i did poorly in high school .
that 's a problem .
not good . my cousin is driving me up the wall .
how so ?
he stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .
have you talk to him about it ?
not yet , but i have to soon . he 's eating me out of house and home . i caught him reading the fridge again last night
ahahah , maybe that will help you lose weight .
this is no laughing matter , nick .
sorry paul . i could n't help it . so why does n't he give you a hand ?
he watch the tob too much . now really i do n't know . but i ca n't handle this much longer .
well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , ok ?
yes , that 's right .
what do you suggest i should see in new york ?
well , how about the museum of modern art ?
no , i do n't like museums . they 're boring .
why do n't you go to see the empire state building ?
ah ! that sounds interesting .
it 's gone with the wind .
why do you like it best ?
i enjoy the various characters and the plot .
well . i like the thom birds best .
is it very interesting ?
sure . i like the writer 's language , too .
if i have a chance , i 'll enjoy the book .
would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
cool , fellow , what 's the date today , buddy ?
it 's ... oh it 's the 1st april , april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it , did n't you ?
how can you be so sure ?
he knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too .
yes . are you going to be taking a class from him ?
yes , but i have never taken his class before .
he is very interesting and challenging . is that what you are looking for ?
yes , that 's what i need .
he is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . are you willing to study hard ?
yes , i guess so .
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
yes , i had a teacher like that before .
did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ?
no , i did n't , but that could be a good thing .
well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . good luck !
i 'm not feeling well . i 'm very nervous .
take it easy . we are going to have our own baby . you should be happy .
yeah , i know .
the doctors and the nurses will help you . and i will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
thank you , dear . i feel better now .
yeah . it 's been raining a lot these days .
i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
have you heard when it 's supposed to get better ?
i saw the weather report , and it 's going to rain for the next eight days .
that sucks so much . what are we going to do ?
i 'm getting pretty bored . we should do something despite the rain .
i 'm with you . what do you have in mind ?
i have n't been to the mall in a long time . let 's go there .
that sounds good . they have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .
great . i 'll stop by your place now .
ok . do n't forget to bring your umbrella . the rain can start up again anytime .
professor donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?
yes , i am applying on it .
i wonder if i could enroll in it . i know it is a graduate course and i ' m a junior , but ...
are n't you a bit young ? i have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
i know , but geology of the american west is my major interest and i have done a large reading in the field .
well , if you think you are ready , i 'll let you enroll .
oh , thanks , professor donald . this is really very nice of you .
come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! i ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine .
you think so ? oh , no ! how can he do this to me ? i ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! why else wouldn ’ t he call ?
but , you two are on a break . theoretically he can do whatever he likes .
he ’ s the love of my life ! i ’ ve really messed this up .
come on , hon . pull yourself together . it ’ s going to be alright .
but i ... i still love him ! and it ’ s all my fault ! i can ’ t believe how immature and selfish i was being . i mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . i ’ ve totally messed this up !
you know what , veronica , i think you should make the first step . i ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ...
no , this is not gon na happen ! i ... i ’ ve ruined everything ...
do you hear something ?
to be honest , i was just dumped .
oh , i 'm sorry to hear that . you can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
no , thanks . i 'm not in the mood for traveling .
come on . a trip will do you good . are you doing anything this weekend ?
i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
well , my friends and i are planning on going to shangri-la on saturday . do you want to come with us ?
where is that ?
not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours .
what 's there to see ?
there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .
oh , sounds nice .
yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like .
ok . then i can make up my mind .
yes , just once .
what was the reason ?
i once played truant when i was in college because i intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in sichuan .
oh , i ca n't . i have a date !
really ? wow with who ?
this girl i 've been chatting with for the past couple of months . she 's really cool and she 's driving over here this weekend .
wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
yeah ! i signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! you fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
that is kind of weird ! what if she is a psycho or something like that ?
it 's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! i am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! i think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
i guess it does seem logical . i 'll have to check it out !
stay for dinner with us .
i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have a dinner party at seven tonight . you see , i am going to england the day after tomorrow .
well , i wo n't keep you then . it was very nice of you to come to see me .
it has been a pleasure . goodbye .
goodbye . thank you again for coming .
sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried.what ’ s on your mind ?
we need to talk .
okay ...
i ’ ve been thinking , and well , i think we need to start seeing other people .
what ? why ? i mean , we ’ ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ?
that ’ s just it , i ’ m not happy anymore , tim . it ’ s not you , it ’ s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
so , what are you saying ? you ’ re breaking up with me because i ’ m perfect ?
tim , you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh , i could say that i ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . i know i ’ d only hurt you , i know i ’ d only make you cry .
baby , come on . don ’ t do this to me ! whatever it is , we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this , but we got ta stick together ! don ’ t leave me .
i can ’ t , tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i ’ m only doing this for you . i don ’ t really wan na go but , deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do .
laura ...
here are your keys . i ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i ’ m sorry , tim . i wish you all the best , and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ’ ll always love you . goodbye .
what 's wrong , honey ? take it easy .
i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it 's so terrible .
me too . but i think we can do something else for a change .
you know i work with my professional knowledge not passion . sometimes i do n't know what the meaning of working is ?
but you did a good job . you always perform the best in our company .
yes , that 's in the past . maybe i need to go to my psychologist for help .
perhaps you 've just tired and you need a vacation .
i was full of ambitions before . but now i have no aim for my career .
maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .
that sounds interesting . but i do n't know how to do that .
how about a training course ?
a training course ? that must be costly .
but it 's worth it . maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .
ok , let 's have a try .
ok .
oh , yes . you ?
yes . what did you think of it ?
i thought it was better than the others-i really liked it . what did you think of it ?
yes , i liked it , too . it was exciting , but not over the top . do you know what i mean ?
mmm . that 's what i thought too . i really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . and i always enjoy watching pierce brosnan .
oh , yes . he 's brilliant . did you like the title song ?
not as much as last time , actually . what 's the name of the american actor who was in the supporting role ?
hum , edward norton , or something like that . did you like him ?
yes . he was excellent . they worked well together , do n't you think ?
i do n't know . i think the woman was better . she provided a good love interest . lucky james bond !
yes !
i 'm going to buy a cd .
why not listen to music online ?
then i will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , is n't it ?
you can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you need n't pay for it .
i have downloaded one , but it still ca n't be listened .
in order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .
can you recommend some to me ?
certainly . realplayer is a good .
can i download it ?
yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .
i 'll try it tonight .
yeah , richard said something to me that i did n't appreciate .
oh , no . i know how insensitive he can be . what has he done now ?
he asked me how long it took me to learn english .
but , you were born and raised in california !
yeah , but i get that sometimes . it does n't matter how many generations my family has lived in the u . s . , we 'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
what a racist ! how can you stand working with the guy ?
you know , richard is n't such a bad guy . he made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
so , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english ?
i told him 28 years . and , he knows i 'm 28 years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week . he was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
are you sure he really got the message ?
yeah , i 'm pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn english .
that 's hilarious ! what did he say ?
he said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . he apologized and now , it 's all good .
i 'm glad . i bet he wo n't make that mistake again .
yes , it 's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him .
i see.did they succeed in the end ?
of course not.he drowned .
i would like to use a computer .
do you have your library card ?
i sure do .
there is a wait for the computers .
that ’ s all right .
you need to print your name on this list .
okay . now what ?
once a computer is available , i will let you know .
how am i supposed to log on to the computer ?
all you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
that ’ s it ? thank you very much .
to be honest , i 'm really fed up with work at the moment . i need a break !
are you doing anything this weekend ?
i have to work on saturday all day ! i really hate my job !
are you available on sunday ?
yes , that 's my only day off until thursday .
ok , well , my friends and i are planning on going to the beach on sunday . we tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . do you want to come with us ?
that 'd be fantastic ! which beach are you going to ?
it 's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
what should i bring with me ?
we 've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you 'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
i can just use my beach towel . i love lazing around in the sun .
do you like surfing ?
i 've actually never tired . do you have a surfboard ?
we 've got a few . i can teach you how to surf on sunday . it 'll be fun !
i ca n't wait ! it sounds like we 're going to have a great time . how much money should i bring ?
you 'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . my friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
ok , where and when should i meet you ?
we 'll pick you up at your place at noon . be there or be square !
it 'll take us all some time to get used to the change .
why do you say that ? i think you 're making a lot of progress .
no , i 'm not . i try and try and i still ca n't speak it very well .
learning any language takes a lot of effort.but do n't give up . why do n't we practise those dialogues together ?
good idea . that might help .
you are interested in other people ’ s business , aren ’ t you ?
does he mean i am inquisitive or i ’ m noisy ?
yes .
ok , please .
my wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?
i would recommend the mall , it 's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . it has a wide range of shops and restaurants .
thank you . also , we 'd like to do some sightseeing while we 're in town . can you recommend some local attractions ?
how old are your children ?
i have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .
i would recommend a day at the zoo . it 's fun for all the family . there is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip .
it sounds marvelous . thank you for your help .
easter 's a good day for reunions . the family goes to church together .
and after church they come here for lunch ?
yup , a big potluck buffet . and then-notice there are no children around ?
yeah , what 's up with that ?
the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . hide away , yi-jun !
well , i 've been looking forward to seeing you .
what can i get you ?
i 'd love a gin and tonic .
sure , what 's the author 's name , please .
i ca n't remember that clearly . it probably be charles ...
charles dickens ?
no , no , no . i 'm not interested in literature .
ok , do you know the title of the book ?
oh , sorry . i 'm always absent-minded . i remember that i 've put a note in my pocket .
so , show me the note please .
i ca n't find it now .
oh , such bad luck , sir . can you please name the category of the book ?
let me see . it 's not fiction . it 's biography .
ok , i 'll search it for you . a moment , please .
thanks .
i look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .
what is the most important factor ?
obviously i look for improvement as we go along , but i would like you to do your best from the beginning .
how can we keep track of our grades ?
the final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
what if we ca n't get to school ?
you can only miss one class without penalty .
if we have a major problem , will you let us know ?
i will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .
have you thought about the cost ?
there is that .
i believe it 'll be very expensive .
i would like to return some books .
i ’ ll take them .
here you go .
these books were due two weeks ago .
yeah . i totally forgot they were due .
you will need to pay late fees on these books .
how much are the late fees ?
the fee is 25 cents every day .
i have to pay 25 cents a day ?
and that ’ s for each book that is late .
that shouldn ’ t be a problem .
it sure is ! the water looks so nice ! anchor the boat for a little while . i ’ m going to take a dip .
why are you doggy-paddling ? i taught you how to swim ! do your breast stroke !
i get too tired ! i ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier !
try kicking your legs more . that ’ s good . don ’ t go out too far !
it ’ s fine . jump in !
kathy ! get back here ! i see a shark !
ahahah ! ! ! help me ! help ! bring the boat closer ! the shark is coming straight towards me !
it ’ s right under you ! kathy ! ! !
my husband and i got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . but then we had three parties to celebrate .
three parties ? that 's quite a lot . that must have been expensive !
well , since my husband and i are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . it was n't actually that expensive .
were your parents upset that they were n't there to see you get married ?
i would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we could n't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .
did your husband 's family get to meet your family ?
my husband 's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t
that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ?
we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa .
you really did n't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
i 'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
then let 's go in .
i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul , but he 's late .
i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what 's keeping him .
looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before , has n't he ?
yeah , a number of times .
what 's he trying to pull anyway .
i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok , let 's go in , sandy .
i ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . he lives in minneapolis .
and how long do you you plan to remain in the united states ?
i ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . see , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of march .
and , who is sponsoring your trip ?
my brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . i will stay with him and his family in their home .
alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
well , i own a house . actually , i ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . i have a car at home , and oh , my job ! i ’ m employed by tornal as an engineer . actually , i only have three weeks ’ vacation , so i have to go back to work at the end of march .
and what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
well , i do have assets in my country . like i said , i own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
i ’ m sorry , sir , we can not grant you a b2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! you win ! congratulations !
well , i am a bit out of shape . i 'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit .
oh , that 's good news for us .
so what do you provide ?
first of all , we 'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits .
how can you get that done ?
well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . and he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
what else ?
since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
sounds pretty good . what about the charge ?
that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
maybe one month . just have a try first . not too tough at the beginning .
wise decision . you 'll find it 's totally worth it .
my name is jung min . what 's your name ?
my name is jessica . it 's nice to meet you .
yes . it 's nice to meet you too . are you a new student too ?
no . i 'm a sophomore . i take it you are a new student ?
yeah . it 's pretty exciting to be here .
have fun while it lasts . the excitement wears off real quick . especially after you see how much homework you get . where are you from ?
i 'm from korea . my parents wanted me to go to an american university , so i came here .
i have never been to korea . i 've been to japan before , but never korea .
why were you in japan ?
my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . he 's so into learning about different cultures .
that 's pretty cool .
i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents .
well , if you ever want to visit korea , i would be happy to show you around .
thanks for the offer . i 'll keep that in mind . oh , the professor is coming . we 'll talk more after class .
ok .
who ?
john smith , the escaped criminal .
that bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
i think i must report to the cops .
ok .
eh , so so .
and this one ? too flashy ?
nah , not too flashy .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn ’ t it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .
and i ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it ’ s the third quarter and you ’ ve been blabbering on since the first !
oh , your precious game . you watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn ’ t . you didn ’ t just insult the sals-bury seals , did you ? why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
yes , fine . i had something wrong with my stomach . i won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious .
i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
i think most people are a little nervous about it . i was really very , very nervous just before i had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing i remember was waking up after the operation .
it must have really hurt afterwards .
well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . i wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . that was the worse thing .
i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
i certainly was ! however , the doctor gave me a list of food i couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !
is there any pain now ?
no , not at all . i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .
did they take good care of you in the hospital ?
oh , yes . the nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what i could drink . in the end , i just drank water and nothing else . everyone was very professional and i actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .
i had a fantastic time .
everything goes well , but i am thinking about quitting my current job .
why ? you ’ re not satisfied anymore ?
i just sense . but i can not grow anymore . my boss is not really supporting me . i am interested in some positions in other jv companies , but i need to do some more in-depth research before i send my application letters out .
that is important . doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
certainly , it is very nice talking with you . but i really have to go now . catch you later .
ok , good luck to you .
yeah , i 'm worried . if it 's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled .
let 's hope it clears up .
yeah , i 'm afraid so .
if there 's one thing that bugs me , it 's her critical attitude .
yes , it is annoying .
nothing particular . but , ...
what 's the matter ?
i , i do n't know how to explain it to you .
go ahead . it 's nothing serious . we are good friends , are n't we ?
yes , of course . but i 'm afraid i ca n't tell you .
how do you do ? nice to meet you , ms . smith . i ’ m jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card .
it ’ s nice to meet you , mr . stevens .
please call me jack . have a seat , please .
thank you .
you 're welcome .
that 's all right .
not much . just sitting here eating some chinese food . is that the paper ? why do n't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
ok , wait a minute ... let 's see . i 'm a taurus , and it says , mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse venus . i do n't know what that means , but then it says , your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . remember to be positive . sounds good to me .
what about gemini ? what 's the prediction ?
since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter , your fortunes are falling . bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . be careful .
that sounds bad ! i 'm really worried , what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
but we have a date tonight ! you ca n't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
that sounds great . where are you going ?
i think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .
what should i bring ?
nothing . just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . we 'll bring everything .
i feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter 's disease .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell form the way he spoke to us .
never believe his words .
i guess we should invite him . i just hope he does n't start talking about sylvester stallone and arnold schwarzenegger again .
oh , come on ! the game is better with three people . anyway , if we do n't ask him to play , he 'll be mad .
yeah , you 're right . we 'll never hear the end of it .
yes , i am .
shall we have dinner together ?
do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
yes , i do . i know a place that has excellent food .
ok . i 'll be happy to join you .
the board has been considering introducing flex time .
good news . ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .
yes .
where did you learn ?
i learned in college .
you speak really well .
thank you .
how long have you been in the u . s . ?
3 weeks .
is your wife with you ?
yes , she just got here yesterday .
have you been to california before ?
no . i 've never been there .
have you ever been to las vegas ?
yes . i went there once on a business trip .
i ’ m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that ’ s very fast for a kid his age .
he ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
he ’ s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again , that ’ s fine for someone his age .
two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long-distance running ?
the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
how are they at swimming ?
they ’ re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
i ’ d be afraid to jump from that height !
i think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
it seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
sorry , i thought you knew .
but you should have told me you were in love with her .
did n't i ?
you know you did n't .
well , i 'm telling you now .
yes , but you might have told me before .
i did n't think you 'd be interested .
you ca n't be serious.how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
sorry , i did n't think it mattered .
oh , you men ! you 're all the same .
yes . you 've done a good job . but there 's one thing . you should narrow down your topic .
what about water pollution instead of pollution ?
i ’ m fine . thank you .
do you need anything ?
i need you to help me .
what can i do for you ?
i am looking for an article in a newspaper .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn ’ t even bother to think of that .
i ’ ll show you where to find your article .
i get lost in this library .
it ’ s right this way .
thanks a lot for your help .
tonight ? i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've promised mark to go to the gym . can we make it tomorrow ?
no problem . let 's say 6:30 p . m . at the royal restaurant , ok ?
all right . see you tomorrow night .
god ! do n't you think they should get you an assistant ?
yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody 's turned up , and i have to do the work alone . this is the first break i 've had all day .
they 're really running you into the ground . why do n't you ask for some time off ? you could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
i 'm afraid i ca n't before i finish this project .
you 'd better pay more attention to your health .
i will , thanks for your concern .
you 're welcome .
what happened ?
my som was lost . i told him to stand rooted to the spot when i went shopping , but he ignored it .
how did you find him at last ?
it was the police wo helped me to do that .
it must have taught you a lesson this time .
why ? i think it ’ s convenient and good .
no . the decoration has been out-of-date . my friends have a whole kitchen now . it ’ s modern .
why should we run after the fashion ?
i am not running after the fashion . i just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .
i 'm crazy about it.it makes me very excited .
then tell me what 's good about it .
it ca n't be expressed by words .
i have no idea . maybe she had a fight with her husband .
wow , fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal .
yes , it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
oh , yes . my wife bought it for me yesterday . hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . yellow suits you really well .
maybe . several people have suggested that i get more yellow clothes . they say the color suits me because i have a fair complexion .
that 's right . you know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . actually , i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . it 's just that different colors can give people different impressions . for example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .
thank you for your compliments . it sounds like you 're a clothing expert .
well , compared with my wife , i 'm just a beginner .
yes , i ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ?
i ‘ m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
you ’ re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what ’ s you favourite award category ?
you might think this strange , but i like the category for best foreign language film .
it ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education .
most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job .
but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .
there are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .
what kinds of parades are there ?
the parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . what do you do on national day in your country ?
we don ’ t have a national day .
really ? that ’ s unusual .
i guess it is . most countries have on , but we don ’ t .
actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . in the evening , many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day .
no , not this weekend . i have too much work to do .
where do your parents live ?
my father lives in washington dc .
how about your mother ?
my mother died two years ago .
oh , i am sorry to hear that . is your father still working ?
no , he 's retired .
do you have any family here ?
yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
do you see them a lot ?
not as much as i 'd like to . usually just on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas .
not great . it 's a kind of boring .
really ? i heard it was supposed to be great .
yes , me too . but i 'm disappointed .
nothing .
why do you look unhappy ?
i ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .
oh , cheer up . he ’ ll understand you .
i hope so .
really ?
but i think henry is a backroom boy.he always helps her with her study .
you 're right .
that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it .
thanks . let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . are you free ?
yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5pm , ok ?
no problem . see you !
see you !
i do ! my favorites are mexican , thai , and indian .
really ? have you ever tried moroccan ?
i ca n't say that i have . what are the basic ingredients ?
i do n't know . a friend of mine said i should try it .
do you know where a moroccan restaurant is ?
as a matter of fact , he gave me this address .
let 's go there for lunch ! i 'm up for an adventure !
but not as good as your mother 's , right ?
actually , it 's better ...
what ? are you kidding ?
no . it was the only dish she was n't good at . so we could use you as the new head chef ...
oh , uncle giovanni . that 's wonderful ! thank you ! thank you !
ok , ok . get back to work . there 's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...
i am going to a movie theater . you know there is a new action film produced by hollywood . a thriller , really .
another terror film ? there is too much terror and violence in the films . do you like seeing such a picture ?
i do n't really like seeing bloody frames , but i appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
no , i did n't . and you ? was it good ?
yes . i did . i enjoyed it a lot.there was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .
how much was the ticket ?
i only paid two dollars for mine .
it 's unbelievable ! they are only married for one month . then who is at fault ?
mary said she could n't put up with tom , for he fell in love with another woman .
do you think they 'll become reconciled ?
no , i do n't think so . she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
what a shame ! their marriage is really a mistake .
sure . beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
to begin with , i have to use chopsticks .
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
certainly . after all , i 've been here for two years . it 's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch
yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm i
anything strang about that ?
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it 's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
oh , sorry ! there 's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .
do n't be so angry . it 's passed anyway .
i ca n't forget it .
you 'd better cool yourself down first .
how many credits for each course ?
three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
thank you , sir , i 'm sure i will .
me too .
why do you hate to go outside ?
i meet too many jerks .
i agree .
this city is full of jerks .
rude people are everywhere .
but what can you do ?
you can yell at them .
and they will yell back at you .
yelling does n't do any good .
no . the best thing to do is just stay home .
you mean you suspect him .
i ’ m not sure . i ’ ll try to prove my feeling .
i hope i can do something for you .
good morning .
what does the paper say ?
nothing much — the same old stuff . a lot of bad news as usual .
well , what ’ s the weather report ?
sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow .
did they find those bank robbers ?
not yet . they were holding two men in ohio , but they let them go . they weren ’ t the criminals after all .
what about the sports page ? what were the scores of last night ’ s games ?
here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself .
it really depends on when and how long
until next weekend . that ’ s ok .
but saturday is my birthday .
i think it ’ s important to do now . we can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .
but it won ’ t be on my birthday .
but your health is more important . believe me !
why ? they are fine .
because they are too violent . some of them are even disgusting .
indeed there are bad games . but many of them are good .
if boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
come on . things are not so bad . boys can learn to use the computer through games .
yes , i am . what 's up ?
then would you please go to a dance party with me ?
with pleasure . i suppose you dance often .
oh , no . as a matter of fact , i have n't danced for a long time .
but i am told that you dance wonderfully well .
thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot , right ?
no . just occasionally .
what 's your favorite dance ?
it 's hard to say , but i do love the foxtrot and waltz .
how about rock'n'roll ?
to tell you the truth , i do n't like it . it 's too noisy .
and the tango ?
oh , it 's really beautiful , but i just ca n't do it well .
do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you can do it very well . then i 'll meet you at six . is that at all right ?
ok .
great ! i 'm your lucky fellow then .
yes , my friends like to get along with me well .
do you have many friends ?
yes , i like to make new friends .
what do you usually do with them ?
we like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
do n't feel like it . i 'm broke .
well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?
just look around ? nah , that ’ s boring .
i 'll go by myself then .
great idea ! peter , i could use the drink .
how about the new bar across the road ?
sounds good . the food there is fantastic too .
i agree , i had lunch there last week .
excellent ! that sounds like a plan .
no , i 'm korean . where are you from ?
i 'm from america . are you settling in all right ?
i 've already found a flat and it 's quite comfortable . what about you ?
i live in my uncle 's house . he came here ten years ago .
what do you think of the local accent here ? has it been causing you any problems ?
i think it 's just a matter of getting used to it .
i ca n't agree more .
yes . they were open this morning when i came to work . they must 've finished remodeling . why do you want to know ?
well , i thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . that is , if you have n't promised to go with someone else .
that 'd be wonderful , peter . but i hope you 're in a better mood than you were this morning .
i 'm sorry i was such a grouch . it must 've been the weather . when it rains i get depressed .
forget it . i 'll see you at 11:30 am .
what 's your excuse this time ?
have i used the one that my sister is sick ?
yes , twice last week .
are you sure ? i thought i said it was my mother .
i do n't think so . but it could 've been .
well . you can trust me this time . my sister is definitely sick . i 'm just coming from the hospital . they say she might even die .
i do n't buy your story . try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
i 'll do my best .
just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
i 'm working on it . really !
not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
what 's the problem ?
she loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that i do . i can never do anything right when she ' s around .
for example ?
well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her .
no , i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . let 's go out and get crazy tonight .
let 's go to the new club on west street .
sure , but what do i wear ?
you can wear that pretty red dress .
nothing really , why , what ' s up ?
if you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun , you will get to know lots of people .
sounds great , i 'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
around six pm .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
ok , i will see you then .
great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
hello , i ’ m mark . i ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend
yes , i think so .
good . i was thinking that i ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate .
what ’ s the time ?
six thirty , tonight .
oh , i ’ m sorry i can ’ t because i have to do some housework.you can ask jenny to go with you
all right.maybe next time i can go with you.bye !
good bye !
do n't ask such a question . you know it has no certain answer . everyone knows it is in his heart .
then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .
maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ?
right .
really ? how did you get the chance ?
you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i don ’ t have to pay for my trip .
congratulations . how lucky you are !
thank you . i ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
i ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . china is such a beautiful country .
i ’ m sure i will .
have a nice journey , lily .
thank you , david .
oh , i love him too . he not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . he then tried at another two auditions .
he had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . and that 's when i started to notice him .
me too .
before he made the top three , i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out .
yeah , there 're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ?
absolutely . that 's why when he entered the final , i was so excited .
he really did a great job in the finale , especially in the pk round . he performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
and the host announced that he won it all !
it is in that brand new , tall building over there . on the 9th floor .
where is the school cafeteria ?
it is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells .
where is the computer center ?
the computer center is on the first floor of the library .
where is the library ?
the library is next to the adminstration building . the adminstration building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . there are school maps for free in the lobby of the admin .
thank you . i will go get one .
sure . glad to be of service . by the way , my name is mike sullivan . you will see me around a lot . i am running for president of the student government .
well , hi ! my name is eve markowski . i am glad to meet you . with your friendly smile and helpful attitude . i am sure you will win .
thanks you for the encouragement .
you are welcome . i ’ d better go . goodbye .
have a good day . bye-bye !
no , thanks . i 've had more than enough.in fact , i must be running along .
stay around for a while.the party is warming up .
i 'm afraid i have to leave . i have to be up early tomorrow .
when is it ?
it falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
ok . the dragon boat festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named quyuan . on that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet 's body .
it sounds so moving .
bob ! i hear your team won the match .
yeah . all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
if i want , i can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until i receive the item .
that proves my point ! protect yourself or you 'll get burned .
ebay also offers free insurance . you can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you 're not satisfied with your purchase .
$ 200 ? if they get a hold of your credit card number , you 're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! i had a friend who ...
oh , it 's nothing to speak of .
no , seriously . i am impressed .
thank you . i appreciate the compliment .
hey tina . what are you doing ?
i was just watching tv . what 's going on with you ?
i just watched a movie and i 'm scared .
what did you watch ?
i saw the sixth sense . i did n't know it was going to be so scary .
i remember that . it was a great movie . but it was definitely scary .
if you 're not busy , do you want to come over ? i 'm afraid to be alone .
sure . i can come over . what should we do ?
how about if we watch a comedy . i need something to get my mind off the frightening images i have from the sixth sense .
ok . i 'll get ready and leave . i 'll see you in about 20 minutes .
hurry , ok . it 's dark out .
do n't worry , nothings going to happen . i 'll be there real soon .
ok . see you soon .
sure i am . i 've been writing a blog for almost three years .
oh , it seems that i 'm the only one who never blogs . when did you get started ?
i began blogging when i first went to the us for my graduate strides .
what do you usually write about ?
at first , i 'll write about my life there . like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special english words that i come across . sometimes , i 'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
that 's interesting . how often do you write a blog ?
it 's random . if there happen to be a lot of things going on , i may add several new entries in a week , and if i 've got nothing to share , i may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
got it . are you still updating your blog ?
sure , since i came back from the us , i 've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic i like .
good for you . i know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
no , not yet . i ’ m still looking . i ’ ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though .
what kind of work ?
i ’ m temping at a pharmaceutic company .
what do you do there ?
mostly office work - filing and so on .
how long is the assignment ?
till the end of the month .
en ... it tastes good . i appreciate what you have done for me .
but we just drove across town . ca n't we just go in to see him one last ...
i 'm afraid not . but at tomorrow 's funeral , the family requested an open casket service .
this is all too fast . he 's my best friend , and now he 's gone .
i 'm sorry . i know it must have come as a great shock .
the viewing was for saying goodbye , and i did n't even get that .
he must be green . it ’ s lucky that we will get off soon .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
oh , that 's how you see it .
yes , i 'm hungry . what types of food sound good ?
maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
i have a great idea of where you might like to go .
can we walk there ?
it 's on the second floor . may i join you ?
of course ! let 's go .
let 's hurry . i 'm starving !
i want to go traveling .
do you have any where in mind ?
yes , i 've been thinking about florida .
sorry , i just worried about him . you know , he should be here an hour ago .
don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and i think he can take himself very well .
but he still does not come back .
maybe he is on the way home now .
for almost two years .
almost two years ? your english is very good .
thank you . but there 's still a lot for me to learn .
johnson ? i ca n't place them .
we met them in bermuda last may .
they 've completely slipped my mind .
the couple with the dogs , think back .
no , i do n't recall a thing about them .
well , i 've invited them for brunch .
hmm , i must be getting absent-minded .
what a miser ! he cycles to school every day .
his grandfather 's money is not his .
i ca n't understand him anyway .
hey , isabelle ...
logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! do n't tell me you 're the guy ! it ca n't be true .
yes , i am the guy ...
what a bummer ! you set me up ?
let me explain . i did n't mean to hurt you ...
well , i 'd like to , but i am not sure i have time .
oh , come on ! just a quick one !
all right , just a quick one .
certainly . jackie chan is a very famous movie star in hong kong . his chinese name is cheng long .
ha , i know cheng long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . and at that time he was promoted as the new bruce lee . but i 'm not familiar with his english name .
ok . then tell me what else you know .
some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . do you know how jackie chan measures his worth ?
he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . by the way , can you count the breaks ?
sure . his skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . as he said ' everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '
indeed you know much about him .
this is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world .
oh , that 's all right .
i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
no , please do n't . i could n't let you do that .
yes , what 's it ?
what does mph stand for ?
it 's miles per hour .
wait ! look at that board , what 's on it ?
' please do n't enter the bamboo groves . ' we 're not allowed to go in .
then we 'd better not go .
ok .
not yet . i 'm not finished with my research yet .
what research ?
reading my fashion magazines ! how do you think i know so much about all the latest trends ?
but they 're just ads .
duh ... that 's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what 's in . plus , there are articles on new trends .
i think there ’ s a western on .
do you mind if we watch it . i ’ d really like to see it .
well , i really wanted to see the football game .
football game ? ok , and you know what comes on next ?
i believe there ’ s a sitcom .
are you interested in watching it ?
let me look in the tv guide first .
oh , i am sorry . what 's on channel 2 at 10 pm ?
if i remember correctly , it 's a quiz show .
do you want to watch it ?
let 's watch it together .
it was funny .
tell me about it , will you ?
well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . it was a magnificent sight .
did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
sure , we would n't miss it for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
you were lucky then . what did you do after that ?
we went for a swim in the sea . that was the best part of the day . just look at my nice tan .
so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
yes , you 're right . and i was so tired that i fell asleep on the way back . my arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
what do i do with it ?
do you want me to help you ?
please .
look . here are the core classes . everyone has to take them .
so i do n't have to worry about them .
you 're catching on ! however , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
i 'll take home economics .
good . now you can pick classes by yourself .
but i ... i do n't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids do n't learn basic skills .
what do you mean ?
they ca n't spell , they ca n't add , they ca n't subtract , they even do n't remember any more . that 's because they rely on gadgets .
that 's not the gadgets . creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . it engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
yeah , what ’ s up ?
next monday is my birthday , and i would like you to attend my party .
wow . i 'd love to .
great !
when and where ?
five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?
yes , i know . i appreciate your invitation .
i am going to invite other guys . see you that day .
see you .
i 'm pretty tired these days .
why ? you 're not working so do n't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
i have so much house work to do . i have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
how about your husband . does he help much ?
not at all . he comes home and complains about his hard day at work . he expects me to do everything . he even wants me to feed him sometimes . can you believe that ?
that sucks .
if he was n't so lazy , i think i would n't have any complaints . he mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
that 's crossing the line .
oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
of course . it 's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ?
of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
that 's true . for various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times , only summer events were included . when it grew popular , there came the winter olympic games , which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then , what 's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye , nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh , i did n't expect you to know them . but yes , i love them not only because of many medals they 've won , but also because of many medals they 've won , but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
i want to travel .
where would you like to go ?
the seaside .
that 's really a good idea . taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . i recommend you qingdao or dalian .
i ’ ve been to qingdao before , so i ’ ll choose dalian . i 've heard that the environment there is very good .
yes , that 's a good place to spend a holiday . last year i went there . it 's really .
thank you !
no , thank you , mrs . carter . i 'm fine for now .
just make yourself at home . the other guests should be arriving shortly .
thank you very much for your kindness .
is there any clue ?
no , he left nothing .
oh , i ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there .
that ’ s a good idea . it must be easy to find a job in shanghai .
i think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .
and english is very useful in your job .
i think it will be very useful in many ways . beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in china , but also in the world , english is useful in almost all walks of life .
you will be a very promising one .
that ’ s my wish .
yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .
i did n't know you had a brother .
oh , yes , he is two years older than me . he lives in new zealand so i do n't see him that often .
oh , nice . is he coming on his own or with the family ?
his son is coming as well . he wants to go to university here in england so they will visit a few universities while they are here .
does your brother have just one son ?
no , he has two daughters as well . his wife and daughters are visiting her parents . so i wo n't see them .
i 'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . they went to new zealand last year and loved it .
so when are they all coming ?
my parents are already here . my brother and nephew are arriving on monday .
i 'm from canada , originally .
from canada ? where were you born ?
montreal .
when did you come to los angeles ?
we moved here when i was fourteen .
did you go to school here ?
well , i went to high school here , but i went to college in texas .
did you get a job right after graduation ?
no , i traveled for a while in europe after college , and then i lived in france .
when was that ?
let 's see ... that was about six years ago .
i bet that was interesting . what did you do there ?
i studied french . anyway ... that 's enough about me.how about you ? were you born in l . a . ?
yes , i 'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
how can you manage to do both ? i mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
i think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . you can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
does your husband feel the same ?
yes . he is very understanding and supportive .
let me give you a little advice . you know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
i often do , but i ’ m worried about the responses from other people .
you have to be realistic . not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
i ’ m worried that what i say will not make sense .
we could chat about the topic before class . i could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that ’ s a good idea . what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ?
that ’ s easy . express possibilities . people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
i didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . they will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how .
where do they come from ?
i do n't know . something rotten here ?
i ca n't see it .
my invitation ? no , i have n't . my invitation to what ?
the house warming party .
whose house warming party is it ?
tom and bill smith . they are both working now you know ? and they 've bought a new house .
oh , they have ? i did n't know . i have n't seen tom lately .
it 's out in the suburbs .
have you seen the house ?
yes , i have . i went out with them last weekend .
is it nice ?
yes , it is . there are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .
there 's also a garden .
well , that does sound nice . have they moved in yet ?
they are moving today . tom 's taken the day off . he 's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
when are they going to have the party ?
next saturday night . you should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
wow , that would be something to look forward to .
i could go for that . but i 'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
oh , but i really need to leave this town for a change . working day after day has worn me out . do you have any other suggestions ?
we should probably think about going somewhere that is n't too far away . how about the countryside ? there must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
wonderful ! i think that 's a great idea . how soon until we can make this happen ? i ca n't wait !
tomorrow i have an appointment with my dentist . what about next monday ?
perfect . i 'll start preparing tomorrow . if we 're going to drive , i 'll need to fill up the tank .
no need . i think it 's still plenty full . even so , i 'd rather travel by bus or train . it would cost much less than driving . oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
we can take the train , that will be faster . i 'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
great ! oh , one more thing , do n't forget to check the weather before we go . i 'd hate to get caught in the rain .
no problem . i 'm really looking forward to the coming week .
me , too . now let 's make a list for what we need to take with us .
sounds good . where are we going ?
somewhere new . it 's a great place to pick up chicks .
need a new . girlfriend , huh ?
yeah , i broke up with lisa.she blew a gasket over it . whoa , get a load of that !
whew ! that getup is terrific !
never mind the getup.she ' s beautiful !
that too .
i 'm gon na introduce myself .
if you 're lucky , that might do the trick .
oh , oh , that tears it ! i 'm getting out of here .
hold on ! what 's the big hurry ?
my ex-girlfriend 's here.if she sees me , my goose is cooked .
i wan na finish my drink first . i 'll meet you at sammy 's .
ok , catch you later .
darlene ! indeed , it ’ s been a while ! how have you been ? wow , you look amazing ! i love what you ’ ve done with your hair !
really ? thanks ! i went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! look at you ! you haven ’ t aged a day since the last time i saw you ! what is your secret !
ha ha , come on ! well , i ’ ve been watching what i eat , and working out three times a week . by the way , i heard your son recently graduated !
yes , my little paul is finally a doctor . they grow up so fast you know .
he is such a handsome guy . he gets his looks from his mother of course !
thank you ! what about your daughter , pamela ? i heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .
oh yes . she had a beautiful wedding in cozumel mexico and we all attended .
such a lovely girl . i hope my paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
but of course ! well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but i have to get going .
same here ! we will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
that would be great ! give me a call !
see you soon ! bye ! egg ... i can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .
yeah . it was hard . when do you take it ?
i take it tomorrow morning . there is so much material that i dont know what to emphasize on . what types of questions did you get ?
mostly on the civil war . you should also study the impact martin luther king jr . had on american society .
what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ?
i only had 1 question about him . but you might get more . i dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
hopefully he will use the same exam , cause im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
if you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .
aright . thanks for the info . i got ta go to the library now .
good luck .
thanks . see ya .
it 's us .
what do you mean by `` us `` ?
well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ?
what do you mean ? we ' re talking now , are n't we ?
oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ?
back to live with my parents . that 's something else i used to do before we were married . remember ?
yes.do you like it ?
it 's great . and i ' ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent .
really ? i 've never heard that before . i just like it .
is classical music your favorite ?
yes . what about you ?
i like pop music best . classical music is a bit too heavy for me . i ca n't get fully relaxed in it .
pop music does n't have any depth for me .
yeah , that 's why i can enjoy myself in it .
did you always like pop music .
i think so , since i was in primary school . how long have you been interested in classical music .
i did n't like it at all until i started to learn violin when i was eight . from then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
oh , i did n't know you can play the violin . do you still play .
sometimes , but these days i 'm often too busy .
most people were living form hand to mouth . how could they ?
yeah . they simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .
fortunately , things are changing these years .
i do n't know if anything terrible has happened .
i have reported it to the police .
we 'd better prepare for the worst .
he won the decathlon in the 1976 olympics , right ?
i read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
i can think of better things to dream about ...
sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
that 's crazy .
what 's wrong with it ?
what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy !
oh ...
it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
sorry , love .
what are you looking for now ?
my cigarettes .
well , they ' re not here.they are in the dustbin .
in the dustbin ! why did n't you tell me before ?
yes , i do . but my characters are very bad .
it takes a long time to learn chinese writing .
are you chinese by birth ?
yes , i am . i am from guangzhou . i am here to study international relations .
how do you like it ?
i like it so far . but my english still needs work .
i want to study mandarin and public relations .
sure . it 's probably a skiing show . adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
look at that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
you are right . but what if an avalanche happened ?
they are all great skiers and very experienced . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway , the show is breathtaking . by the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it 's possible .
two , i hope and i hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !
of course ! and here 's the best part , they are court side seats !
how in the world ! who came up with seats like that from your company ?
some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
ca n't beat that ! thank you accounting guy !
the game starts at seven so we 'd better hustle , it 's already five .
what are we waiting for ? let 's go !
good news ! and congratulations !
you are invited to my wedding .
thank you . i 'll certainly be there .
sure . but it 's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .
but i 'm not used to looking up every new word when i 'm reading a novel . i only look up the most necessary ones .
i ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it .
don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ?
definitely . but i think it is too fierce .
sure , but let 's get a pitcher this time we should be able to down it before they close .
that sounds good . you order the beer while i go to the bathroom . where is the can in this place ?
it 's all the way to the back . see that yellow door ?
yeah . i think i can find it .
you 're back already . that sure was quick .
that 's because i just took one step inside and turned right around . that bathroom is too gross for me .
well , the bartender would n't give me the pitcher of beer . anyway . he said it was too close to closing time .
let 's leave then . i could take some fresh air , anyway .
okay , let 's go !
well , i spend a lot of time watching movies .
what a confidence ! i always watch a lot of movies , too .
oh really , frank ? what kind of movies do you like ?
actually , i watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . how about you ?
art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .
really impressive . these two genres are totally different .
sure . i enjoy both of them very much .
how often do you go to the cinema ?
once in a while , i suppose , i usually rent movies at movie salon .
movie salon ? where is that ?
it 's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . i 've got a membership there .
is it good ?
yes , you can find almost all new releases there .
really ? maybe i shall also sign up for its membership .
why not ?
really ? that 's so great . congratulations .
thanks . i 'm so excited . we 've been trying for 8 months now .
that 's really exciting . how many months are you pregnant ?
three months .
are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?
i want to , but bob does n't . he wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
maybe it 's more exciting not knowing .
i 'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
there are so many things you have to prepare for .
i know i am going to be busy , but i know i can handle it . i have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .
it really must be an exciting time for you guys .
thank you so much .
unbelievable ! how do people go through it ?
that 's what i 'm wondering , too .
i wish i had a chance to see it with my own eyes .
much to my regret , i 'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then .
we 'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?
much as we 'd like to , but we 've booked up already for that time .
what a pity ! you ca n't join us .
so sorry . next time we 'll go , thanks anyway .
thank you for your inition . i 'm free tonight .
which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?
i prefer sea food .
ok . i 'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
that 's fine . i 'll be waiting for you .
see you later .
bye .
if that happen to me , i ’ ll take them back to the shop .
i did . but they said they won ’ t change them .
that ’ s terrible . but if they wouldn ’ t change them , i know what i would do .
of course ! it is the no . 1 stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it .
totally agree . what is your solution ?
well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
good . i love chinese food . what did you order ?
something hot and spicy . they look very inviting on the menu . you are going to love them .
maybe we can find a place to learn some chinese cooking . i hear there 's a place in chinatown where you can take some courses . are you interested ?
i 'm not sure . i do n't enjoy cooking that much . as long as we can order it from a restaurant , we do n't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
you are right . but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
i could n't do that . i have an important meeting to go to today .
do you feel ok ?
not really . after a 12 - hour flight , i 've got jetlag , and on top of that , i think i 've also got the flu .
why do n't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? you should really get some rest or you 'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ?
you 're really hot . let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down .
ok . i 'll stay home this morning and rest , but if i feel better in the afternoon , i 'm going to the meeting .
zach , what 's that on your arm ?
i do n't know . it looks a bit red , but i 'm sure it 's nothing .
it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! are you allergic to anything ?
just cats , but i do n't think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
i completely forgot about your cat allergy . i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . oh no . we 'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . let 's go .
should n't we make an appointment first ?
we would , but let 's just go and see if there 's an opening now before it gets worse .
whatever you say . i just want to get to my meeting !
that 's too bad .
yes , most of the time . but , sometimes things can get difficult .
can you tell me about it ?
you know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not .
what can you do when this happens ?
not much , usually i 'll just keep silent .
not yet .
cool , fellow , what 's the date today , buddy ?
it 's ... oh it 's the 1st april , april fool 's day .
you forgot all of about it , did n't you ?
okay . keep in touch .
i ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .
i don ’ t understand , i made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?
yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .
but the reservation keeps the car here . that ’ s why you have the reservation .
i know why we have reservations .
i don ’ t think you do.if you did , i ’ d have a car.see , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . anybody can just take them .
but we do have a compact or an suv if you ’ d like .
fine . i ’ ll take the compact .
alright . we have a blue ford focus for you , mr . fox . would you like insurance ?
yeah , you better give me the insurance , because i am gon na beat the hell out of this car .
did n't you hear ? he was disqualified .
how did that happen ? he 's so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
if he did n't have any drug problems , he would have won .
what ? what kind of drugs was he using ?
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
they are . the only reason they did n't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
that 's so disappointing . i do n't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
i do n't think it 's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
regardless of how much pressure you 're under , there 's never a good reason to take drugs .
i agree . hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
let 's hope so .
that 's because americans love sitcoms .
sitcoms ?
situation comedies . a sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . if there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .
in taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them are n't comedies .
i think americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
you , too .
you see , i 've been offered a new job . i ca n't decide whether to take it or not .
oh , that 's easy . if it 's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . that 's my advice .
it is n't that easy . i hate to quit my present job . people around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
then what about the salary ? would you get more ?
yes , they say i would get a big sum .
have you discussed it with your wife ?
yes , she leaves it to me .
as i say it the work is well worth try . after all you can get a higher salary .
i have to think about it .
both actually . s , y , b , i , l .
of course .
that ’ s great . he ’ s the best runner i ’ ve seen this season . i ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the olympics .
i think you ’ re right . i think we have a very good athletics team . they should do well in the olympics . how many medals do you think we ’ ll win ?
i really don ’ t know . i don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but i think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
what do you think our chance are in other events .
in the last olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . i think we ’ ll do well in those same events .
we might get a gold medal in the sailing too . our team put in a lot of practice .
i think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
you are very optimistic !
really ? but his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .
i hear that john 's leading a double wife .
it 's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
i have n't played chess for a long time .
that 's all right , i 'm a beginner . i 've just learnt how to play .
look , there 's a chessboard . those two men have already finished playing .
you 're a very good player
not really , but once i won a prize .
so did i . i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
my prize was for the best player in the country . now let 's start playing chess seriously .
harry potter .
harry potter ? is that book funny ?
actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that 's funny .
got it .
have you ever read this book before ?
no , but my little brother likes it very much .
it 's really a good book . you will like it too .
i 'll try to read it . actually , i like literature very much .
wow , that sounds like a scholar . by the way , who 's your favorite writer ?
jane austen .
me too . pride and prejudice is my favorite .
i like it too . but sense and sensibility is my favorite .
thanks , tim.nice meeting you , too .
i guess we 'll see just around .
ye , i hope so.well.take it easy .
you too .
i 've had it with tim ! i think i 'm going to quit !
but sandra ... you love your job ! you spent months trying to get this position . it 's perfect for you !
yeah ... i know . but i 'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
basically , i think tim is threatened by me . i 'm doing a better job than he is so he 's trying to sabotage my career !
so he talks about you behind your back ?
yes . he 's all nice and friendly to my face . but the second i turn around he stabs me in the back !
i had a worker like that once . she was always taking credit for my ideas .
i should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary i can prove it was my effort .
my co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . she liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday i was chatting with tom . she meant tom solomon ... our ceo .
what is it ? what happened ?
i think someone is stalking me .
no , it ca n't be . really ? who ?
i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring.he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop .
what did you do ?
i did n't do anything . finally , he left.but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's . but then he came in too .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
yes , i know a great place . what types of food do you like ?
mexican , japanese or chinese would be great .
oh , i know a place where you might like to eat .
is it close by ?
it 's down a block on the right ; can i show you the way ?
ok , i 'd love the company .
this will work out well . i 'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
when i was young , my parents took me to the one in california . i always forget which — is that one disneyland or disneyworld ?
the one in florida is disneyworld and the one in california is disneyland , so you must have been to disneyland .
that 's right . why do you ask ?
well , i 've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon .
when are you getting married ?
some time next year . we have n't set the date yet .
congratulations ! i had no idea .
thank you . so what do you think ? would we have a good time ?
do you like amusement parks ?
for the most part , yes . some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
if you do n't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you 'll have a good time .
even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
even those . it 'll be very romantic , i think . you 'll have loads of fun .
thanks for the advice . i 'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
i 'm sure he 'll love the idea . just throw yourself into it and you 'll enjoy it !
steve ! have n't seen you in ages ! how long 's it been ?
it 's got to be almost a year now .
how have you been ?
i 'm pretty good . i 've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i do n't want to renew it .
yeah , i remember the neighborhood . have you found a place yet ?
not yet . but i am still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck .
well , maybe i can help . remember my neighbor ?
mrs . thou ?
yes , her daughter 's having a baby , so she 's moving in with her to help out . i think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .
great . it 's a lovely neighborhood . and it would be nice to be neighbors again . it would be just like the old days !
i 'll ask mrs . thou when she 's available to show the apartment and let you know . has your number changed ?
yeah . dig my new pants ?
copycat !
what do you mean ?
you went out and bought khakis , too !
no . mine are a soft brown . yours are khaki .
whatever .
no , what ?
he 's got a promotion .
you 're kidding .
no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i do n't believe it.he is only being with the company for two years .
well , it 's true.the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .
well.good for him .
i think the supermarket is closed now .
oh , when does it close ?
it closes at 7:00 on sundays .
that 's too bad .
do n't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . it opens at 8 : 00 .
alright . what do you want to do now ?
let 's take a walk for a half an hour . my sister will get here at about 8 : 30pm and then we can all go out to dinner .
where does she live ?
she lives in san francisco .
how long has she lived there ?
i think she 's lived there for about 10 years .
that 's a long time . where did she live before that ?
san diego .
no . how about you ?
not yet . let 's go to that restaurant on the corner .
search me .
what did you argue about ?
he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn ’ t have the money yet .
well , he should pay you back . it ’ s only fair .
yes , but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn ’ t have got angry .
did you lend him a lot of money ?
not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill , so i needed the money back .
well , talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it ’ s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
no , we didn ’ t . i guess you ’ re right . we should patch things up .
of course you should . you wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
i don ’ t think so . i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
no , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
yes . dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . they are also the fastest swimmers in the world .
they must be amazing animals .
they are . i read a story about a dolphin saving a a from drowning in the sea .
i read that story too . they seem to be able to understand men .
they sure can . maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
all right .
here is your ticket .
thank you .
the park will close soon . we should better go in right now .
really ?
yes , let 's go in .
it is a new park , is n't it ?
yes , how do you know ?
i guessed it .
well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world 's tourist attractions as well .
oh , how wonderful !
i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
horses are useful to people too . we use them for sports and recreation .
don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
can you ride a horse ?
yes , i can . i don ’ t ride regularly though . how about you ?
i can ride too . perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?
what a good idea !
just call her lisa , mary . she 's cooking dinner .
i see . can i sit down ?
of course ! make yourself at home .
thank you , mr . johnson .
please , just call me tom .
okay , tom .
where 's cindy ?
she 's upstairs in my room .
can you tell her to come downstairs ? we 're about to have dinner .
no , what ?
he 's got a promotion .
you 're kidding .
no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
oh , i do n't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years .
well , it 's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .
well . good for him .
yes , and it 's great . what are the events at the sports meeting ?
long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on .
our neighbor , bruce , will take part in the relay race . let 's go have a look .
ok , let 's go .
the competition will begin in 5 minutes , it 's tense here .
wonderful , bruce is taking the lead .
other competitors have almost caught up with him . they are neck and neck .
come on , bruce . come on , bruce .
wow , bruce crossed the line first .
yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful .
you are right . they sweep nancy off her feet . and now she fell head over heels in love with him .
how wonderful it would be if i had such smiles !
yes , it 's been marvelous . it really was very kind of you to invite me . i hope it has n't been too much trouble .
not at all . we 've really enjoyed having you . i hope you 'll come and stay again next time you 're in changsha .
do you already know how to play an instrument ?
uh ... yeah ! i ’ ve told you a thousand times that i ’ m learning to play the drums . now that i know how to play well , i would like to form a rock band .
aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?
we have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . you told me that you had some musical talent , right ?
yes , i ’ m a singer .
perfect . so you can audition this weekend here at my house .
great ! wait here ? you don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! by the way where do you keep them or practice ?
i would like to have that new style gl joe .
have you asked santa ?
yes and i 've written him a letter .
george , how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent .
well , lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me , it won ’ t cost much .
where will we sleep , then ?
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let ’ s see . gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . come on . don ’ t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard , haven ’ t we ?
maybe you ’ re right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can ’ t wait !
oh , i don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet .
as long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food , so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let ’ s go to chicago.we can have lunch in chinatown.then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field !
you have such good ideas !
the science field trip is next monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . do you want to make note of that on your calendar ?
yes , i will make note of that .
next monday is december 2nd . the buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7
i will be there half an hour early .
you might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on december 8th . do you have a ride ?
yes , someone is picking me up .
to get back to campus by 8
not at the moment — maybe later , though .
all of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . see you on monday !
i 'm sorry for hero .
i do n't think there 's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
do n't be too critical . we ca n't expect it to be perfect .
great - they wined and dined us all week .
my boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . i did n't know you were working here.what a surprise.how long have you been doing this ?
two years or so .
that is great.do you have to work the night shift ?
no , in most cases i do n't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . i work five days a week .
do you enjoy work here ?
it is hard to say.but i 've to start by working as a trainee before i really become an experienced marketing assistant.sometimes , i am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
take it easy . i 'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . i hope you have n't been given much trouble in the job .
luckily not.the silent i meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
glad to hear that .
what 's the second solar system ?
it 's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .
is this good news or bad news ?
it 's exciting news ! if we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !
you mean with people on it ?
yes ! is n't that exciting ?
so what are you gon na do ? just quit ?
that ’ s exactly what i am going to do ! i ’ ve decided to create my own company ! i ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
have you ever written up a business plan before ?
well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?
you couldn ’ t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .
well , that seems easy enough .
wait , there ’ s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? then comes the hard part , a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has ! all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .
geez . is that all ?
almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . after all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
umm . i think i ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
so i heard .
what ’ s wrong with her ?
she went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .
how about a movie ? we have n't done that for a while .
a movie ? sure . do you know what 's on right now ?
no . why do n't you check out the newspaper ?
ok . maybe you should invite your sister along , too .
not much , that new reality-tv show , ally mcneal , oooo , dark angel .
wait a second . i want to watch ally mcneal .
oh , come on . that ’ s such a girl ’ s show .
no it ’ s not . it ’ s just funny .
yeah , if you ’ re a girl .
well , you just want to watch dark angel because of the hot girl .
that ’ s not true . dark angel is a good show .
it ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
o . k . , o . k . let ’ s forget it . there ’ s a football game on too .
no way . i ’ m watching ally mcneal . go to john ’ s to watch the game .
what are you talking about ?
don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all .
you said it . many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children .
i went shopping .
did you buy anything ?
yes , i bought a few things .
what did you buy ?
i bought this coat . do you like it ?
yeah , i like it a lot . it 's very pretty . where did you buy it ?
at the mall on 5th street .
was it expensive ?
no , it was n't expensive . it was on sale for 20 dollars .
that 's cheap .
i know . it was a really good deal .
i do n't think you 'll need to wear it for a while . it 's been really hot lately .
oh , i 'm fine .
so , are you going to go to class tonight ?
maybe ... but i do n't think so .
really ? what 's the matter ?
i do n't know . i 'm just feeling a little sad .
listen . come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
now that 's a good idea . thanks a lot , brian . i 'm feeling better already .
he can barely make ends meet .
wow , i ca n't catch my breath . you are running too fast , honey .
you just need more exercise .
yes , but you need to slow down . this is jogging , not racing !
i do n't care . i want to burn up my fat .
but running so fast is not good for people over forties .
why ?
we are not as athletic as we were when young . mild exercise is more suitable for us .
but i want to burn up more calories !
in fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
really ? i will slow down then .
fine , thank you . i haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . what have you been up to recently ?
i have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you would n't have seen me . recently , i 've been obsessed with horror films .
oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? they 're so scary .
yeah , you are right i used to not watch horror films , but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month , i fell in love with them .
it 's amazing . but if i were you , i would n't have the courage to watch the first one .
but it 's really exciting .
maybe , but i would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i would n't dare sleep at night after watching one .
basically . you 'll watch any type of movie except horror .
yep .
i think you should have a try someday . maybe you 'll change your mind .
maybe . after all , i am grown up now .
the economy has been stagnant for a while now . we 've been in a recessive state for several months already . what worries me the most is the trade deficit . i think the government should do more to encourage exports .
increasing exports would weaken the currency . i think the main point is economic growth . we need more jobs . factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . if more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .
it 's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? if unemployment falls , there 's pressure to increase pay . that would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .
not really . i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . i hardly know anything about art or sculpture . you are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?
i love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .
i never understand the meaning of those painting . they are too abstract for me . i didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school .
art isn ’ t for everyone . i ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . it ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
i like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or greece . what time are you thinking of going ? i ’ d love to go with you .
i thought i ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . does that sound ok to you ? bus 51 goes directly there .
that sounds fine . what time shall we meet at the bus stop ?
let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .
hello , jack.happy birthday !
my birthday ? i forgot it , thank you for remembering my birthday .
i 'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . i 've asked the fairy flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . i hope you 'll like them .
thanks a lot . i 'm so touched .
now let me sing `` happy birthday `` for you .
thank you very much .
it sure is .
it 's a good day for a picnic .
i do n't want to .
well , come over and talk to me then .
certainly not .
may i turn on the tv then ?
turn on the tv for what ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner , will you ?
i will , but let 's go to the disco after dinner .
to a disco ? oh , no . you know i hate it .
brian ! how have you been ?
pretty good . say , you 've really changed !
oh , well , i 've lost some weight . and my hair is longer than before .
well , you look great ! how are you ?
i 'm doing really well . i got married about three years ago . i have two kids now .
that 's terrific !
it 's very nice . there are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .
well , do you all major in the same subject ?
no , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
that 's great !
well , i swim and run every day .
now , tell me , what do you eat ?
well , i do n't eat any meat , but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
chill ! i 'm just curling my eyelashes .
it looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
you 're such a wimp ! you 're afraid of an eyelash curler .
well , you might pinch your eyelid ! or lose an eyeball !
it just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
yes . i 'm afraid so .
but you 'll miss out on the football game .
oh . well , it ca n't be helped .
oh , do you really think so ?
of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours .
but i just got a call from my sister and i have to cancel the movie tonight .
that 's terrible !
you see ? every cloud has a silver lining .
come on ! you 're pulling my leg .
really ! here 's my trophy .
wow ! congratulations !
thank you .
is that your wedding ring ?
i 'm not married yet . it 's my engagement ring .
well , congratulations . when is the big date ?
in june .
did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
actually , we bought the ring together after i got the watch .
you did a fabulous job with the selection . it 's gorgeous .
thank you so much .
what kind of watch is it ?
it 's a tag heer .
if you do n't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
this one is $ 1500 . but they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
that 's why it looks so nice . i should have figured . you always get what you pay for .
yeah . i would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
what for ? ( why ? )
not very well .
why ? looks like you 're feeling very down ! what happened ?
nothing .
come on . for a man who 's feeling so , down , there 're usually two reasons . either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . since you 're so successful , it must be the latter .
well , you 're right . i just broke up with jane .
oh , i 'm sorry . i thought you two were made for each ocher .
well , you never know . i 'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she 's still young .
well , she is not to blame . it 's always difficult to choose between career and family .
maybe you 're right .
jack , i do n't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !
yeah , but it 's hard to forget her at moment . you know , we were together for almost five years . it 's really hard ...
sally . she is a bachelor girl . she is an excellent designer . many of the company 's advertisements are her child trains .
why is she still single ? she must have a face that would stop clock .
oh , quite the other way round . she is a knock-out . she devotes much of her time to her career .
my watch is a few minutes fast . it 's about six forty , i think .
is it ? oh , no . the concert will begin in twenty minutes . are we too late to get there ?
if we start now , we can make it by taxi .
yeah .
who won ?
china .
what is the score ?
china beat brazil three to zero .
wonderful .
the boss wanted to pay bob with stock options . but bob did n't want to play that game again .
again ?
at his last start-up , bob worked for stock and no salary . they folded and he made zip .
ouch .
now he only works freelance . hundred bucks an hour .
i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again .
try to be more careful in future . look ! you 've damaged the sign .
is this the sign ? what does it says ?
it says no smoking here .
sure . take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
first , i ’ ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
that ’ s correct . it ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . the main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
how do you research your books ?
i always visit the places that i use as setting for stories . readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! i usually base my characters on people i have met . most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
i really like your books . i ’ ve just finished this one . i read it from cover to cover in a single day . congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
thank you . let met sign it for you ... there you go .
oh ! thank you very much . i heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . what are the stories about ?
there ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . i haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . if you give me your business card , i ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
thanks very much . i ’ m sure it will sell well . i can ’ t wait to read it . here ’ s my card . thank you for you time .
that 's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !
i hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
that is right up my alley . you say party and i 'm there .
perfect . it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
will it be an all day event ?
yes . and we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
that was quick thinking .
cool ! flashy red lines !
i think this is the coolest watch i 've ever owned .
is it waterproof ?
is n't that a silly question ? you know how much of an athlete i am .
uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
well , surfing , scuba diving ...
yeah , everyday . and there ’ s only one choice . all the other buses are going the other direction .
hmm . i have the same problem . when i leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . so the buses are always crowded .
oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . i will tell you the funniest thing i have seen in china . it ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
that sounds terrible the way you describe it . but you know , not long ago i really suffered on the bus .
what happened ? were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
you just can ’ t imagine ! i waited for the first bus but it was too full , so i waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . then i decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . it was so full that i had to stand on one foot ! no kidding !
hmm . good exercise , uh ?
yeah , absolutely !
and it ’ s so much fun . one day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . i was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
you were so happy , weren ’ t you ?
what do you think ? i ’ m a good boy .
that 's great .
now let 's get things ready .
do n't worry . there are all kinds of things in the center .
that 's much more convenient . we do n't even have to bring the flavorings .
yeah , they all received very strict training . a minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .
and all their movements are so elegant . it seems like dancing in the water .
exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
there you go ! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming .
that 's my boy ! katherine curtis created this activity in 1920 . and in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in olympic games .
wow , mom is more knowledgeable than dad . i must learn from you .
my little boy , you should learn more from me . i 'm almost thirty years older than you .
ok , you 're the boss . look , mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
oh , my god . it 's so dangerous . and he might break his leg . you must n't do anything like that .
the boy is good for nothing .
as a teacher , i don ’ t know how to help him .
he is hopeless .
of course , they are out there .
but i never saw them .
are you stupid ? they are called ufos , so not everybody can see them .
you mean that you can them .
that 's right . i can see them in my dreams .
they come to the earth ?
no . their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
aliens from the outer space ? do you talk to them ? what do they look like ?
ok , ok , one by one , please ! they look like robots , but they can speak . their mission is to make friends with human beings .
that means that you talk to them ? in which language ?
of course in english , they learn english on mars too .
wow . sounds fantastic !
sure . what 's up ?
yes , that 's right . that 's the poster of the the witch .
may , i really regret watching it with you last night .
did it scare you ?
of course not . i just thought the movie was ... boring .
boring ? come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .
well , i admit . the ghosts were scary .
i like scary movies .
that 's gucci 's influence . i love science fiction movies !
of course you do . they are silly stories just for little kids like you .
do n't call me kid . i am a grownup .
do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?
of course ! i can watch them without you !
oh , really ?
i am chinese by birth .
where is your domicile place ?
my domicile place is hebes province .
he 's going to turn six next month .
who is looking after him ?
my mother-in - law . she retired last year .
you really are lucky !
yeah , i know .
mmmm ... it 's hard to say . i like golf a lot-but i guess i like tennis better .
do you play much tennis ?
yes , quite a bit . how about a game sometime ?
sorry . i 'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... i watch them all .
hello , george .
have you just been to the cinema ?
yes , i have .
what ’ s on ?
paris in the spring .
oh , i ’ ve already seen it . i saw it on television last year . it ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good .
paris is a beautiful city . i have never been there . have you ever been there , ken ?
yes , i have . i was there in april .
paris in the spring , eh ?
it was spring , but the weather was awful . it rained all the time .
just like dear old london !
i swear never to drink again . just give me another chance , please !
how many chances have i given you ? i don ’ t trust you any more .
you know how hard i 've tried to give up drinking ? i ’ d be lost without you . i won ’ t let you go anyway .
there are a few stories about natural disasters . there is a massive forest fire in australia . it covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .
was it caused accidentally or naturally ? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa .
nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . the drought in africa is causing starvation . millions of people have migrated to try and find food .
what is the international community doing to help ?
the european union has sent several plants with relief supplies . several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . refugee camps have been set up across the region .
how many countries have been affected ?
six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries .
i saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .
yes . there have been a few there recently . they say that this one was not a big quake . the iranians are dealing with it on their own . they have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u
does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?
so far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital .
oh , i ’ m afraid i can ’ t . i ’ ve had a date already .
that ’ s too bad .
may be some other time .
give it here .
who ’ s the letter from ?
i think it ’ s my acceptance letter from nyu .
i want to know what it says .
they didn ’ t accept me .
are you serious ?
it ’ s the truth .
are you okay ?
i really wanted to get into nyu .
i am really sorry to hear that .
it ’ s okay . i ’ m still waiting to hear from ucla anyway .
my girlfriend just broke up with me .
you must feel terrible now .
yeah .
i remember my first break up . it was the worst feeling in the world . i was crying everyday for three months . and slowly , it got better . i know you 'll feel better too .
you 've been through this too ?
yeah . i remember it very clearly . the pain makes it easy to remember . i know you 're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
but it hurts too much .
i know it 's painful , but it 's only temporary . after the pain goes away , you 'll find other girls .
what if i do n't want to find another girl ?
you 'll change your mind . look at everyone in the world . they all break up and move on . the faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .
you 're right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
yeah . thanks for the talk .
i 'll give you a call later . we should hang out . it 's good to be around people .
ok . i 'll talk to you later .
let me see . the one goes for $ 17 .
would you take $ 12 ?
no , i can ’ t let you have it for 12.how about 14 ?
13.50 ?
sorry , $ 14 is the lowest i can go .
never mind about that .
i ’ m terribly sorry , won ’ t you let me pay for ?
no , i won ’ t hear of it .
nice to see you again , too . peter . how 's your family ?
a : : very well . how 's mrs clinton ?
not bad , but she 's as busy as before .
you are right . we should n't do anything under the table .
well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .
hi , vince . thanks for stopping by . how 's the work coming along for the online auction ?
oh , yeah . i 'm glad you mentioned that . i think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .
ca n't elvin handle it ?
i think he 's got too much on his plate .
how about the soup ?
i 've never tasted anything better .
how nice of you to say so .
not much , just heading over to the shooting range . you wan na come ?
seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don ’ t know man .
yeah , it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa , take it easy there rambo . don ’ t get carried away . these weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . for example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !
wow , i didn ’ t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let ’ s do it !
i ’ m fine . i ’ ve been out of town . i just got back .
where were you ?
i was in new york for a wedding .
i do n't know . my life is a big mess . everything is so complicated .
come on , nothing can be that bad .
but promise me , you 'll keep it a secret .
ok , i promise . so what 's troubling you so much ?
i 've fallen in love with my boss .
really ? is he married ?
no , of course not . he is still single .
then what 's your problem ?
i try to keep it to myself . but there is a lot of gossip about us .
oh , i see . office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .
office romance is very tricky .
it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed .
cheer up , nada . you 'll be fine .
oh , nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired .
with the job ?
with everything , with everybody , with all this !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it was n't always like this , you know .
what do you mean ?
well , i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that 's what 's the matter .
certainly , perhaps .
hey , isabelle ...
logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! do n't tell me you 're the guy ! it ca n't be true .
yes , i am the guy .
what a bummer ! you set me up ?
let me explain . i did n't mean to hurt you ...
how dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
hang on one second . hear me out , just this once , isabella !
why did you lie to me in the email ?
i did n't lie . you just did n't ask me my real name .
i should have known it was you . no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . i thought i might have found the one for me .
i 'm sorry . it was cruel of me . but i promise it will never happen again ? look , there 's a nice restaurant . let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
well , i swim and run every day .
now , tell me , what do you eat ?
well , i do n't eat any meat , but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
yeah .
who won ?
china .
what was the score ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
wonderful !
i would n't be so sure ... people want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .
maybe that 's true for some positions , but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . they dress for success ! you ca n't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . it 's just not respectful to you client .
i think what you wear is so overrated . i would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .
it 's not as simple as that . people judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . so dressing professional is being professional . the image that you portray to others is so important in business . it 's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .
maybe you 're right , but i 'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
what do you mean ?
i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
yes , look over there . that 's the empire state building . my book says it 's 102 stories tall .
it 's quite famous but do n't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
you 're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .
what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue ?
quite a number . actually every skyscraper has a history . a few blocks ahead we 'll see st.patrick ' s cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed rockefeller center . it 's a landmark in the history of architecture .
what 's there after that ?
well then , there 's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
what are they all for ?
most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the world . and there are lots of very expensive places .
i needed to get out of the house . my parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .
what did she tell them ? is she dropping out of college ?
nothing that serious . she finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
and your parents took it badly ?
that 's putting it mildly . my father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .
ouch , that sounds bad . what did your sister do ?
she started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they 're in love and it 's not hurting anybody , and so on . my dad said she 's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .
how long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
three years . they 've been dating since freshman year . they 're even talking about marriage .
really ? then i guess living together would be a good idea .
what do you mean ?
well , these days too many people are getting divorced . if they live together , then at least they 're finding out if they 're really compatible or not .
i guess so . better to find out now than after you 're married , when it 's harder to get out .
yeah , you can count on it .
i think so . yes , they get along so well .
i like him . he 's good for her .
you 're right . he sure is .
he is all right . but i think he seems to have no back bone .
why do you say that ?
whatever things get tough , he gives in .
do n't worry . we 'll make it back to the camp site before dark .
i sure hope so .
oh , we never speak spanish in class ! miss.parker speaks to us only in english .
i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ?
not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said .
it must be interesting to study english .
mario and i are the best students in the class . miss.parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
is english pronunciation easy or difficult ?
sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
yes . i like winter .
me too .
it 's snowing heavily . what about taking a walk ?
that 's a good idea . let 's go !
what a heavy snow ! look ! the water is frozen .
take care ! do n't slip on the ground .
i 've got it . i like the feeling of stepping on the ice .
yes . very wonderful .
there is a snowman over there .
how lovely it is !
just tell him off .
kobe bryant and shaquille o ’ neal , they are the los angeles lakers ’ star players .
oh .
wait a second . he shoots , he scores !
all right !
here comes jordan , though .
wow , michael jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
yeah . he ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing .
which team do you think will win ?
the lakers . jordan is the only good player washington has .
it 's ok . what do you want to ask ?
where should i go after i arrived at the university ?
the first place you should go is the international center .
why ?
you can get help there in dealing with the united states immigration and naturalization service ; you can find foreign student advisers .
what kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
they 'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .
can we get any more help at the international center ?
yes , a lot more . if you go there just before the beginning of the fall 's semester , you can get your student id and social security number there . they will keep your documents up-to-date . they will offer an orientation program for new comers . they will also help you contact your department and registration office .
i see . it must be worth going to .
besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . in cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the international center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .
wonderful . it is a home for foreign students .
it sure is . they also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . the center staff members are also friendly and helpful . everyone loves them .
i can hardly make ends meet these days .
same here . i have't brought any new clothes for three months .
my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
definitely . i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
is that inflation ?
inflation is more than just the rising prices , i guess . but the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
yes . the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
but i 'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
you said it . i think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
how ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . you know , running a car is a big expense .
sounds a good idea .
you should n't grab someone else 's shirt . that 's a foul .
play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
you can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
the touchdown lines are there and there . ok , let 's play !
before we start , let 's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
i took a lot of courses , such as philosophy , logic , ethics , aesthetics , etc .
which course did you like best ?
i liked aesthetics best . it is very impressive .
certainly . what 's the matter ?
i wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
sure . i often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
great ! it 's just like viewless stores . but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
that 's simple . just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place .
is the service charged ?
no . it 's free .
really . i 'll get a computer at once .
it ’ s so cool !
i ’ m afraid this seat is taken .
oh . is it . thank you anyway .
you ’ re welcome . why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ?
thank you .
i feel eggplants are more nutritious .
but as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
oh , that 's how you see it .
hmm ... i 'll tell you what . i 'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week .
it 's a deal .
alps , suppose .
oh , yes , you like skiing .
right .
you were showing respect and admiration for them .
i wish i were a hero .
does the class start again , mam ?
yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
oh , breaktime flies .
come on , baby . it ’ s time now .
mam , another minute , could i ?
hurry up , little boy .
yes , i like collecting things .
oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ?
several things , for example , very coins , stamps , stones and so on .
stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
yes , stones .
well , i can ’ t just imagine it .
yes . how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
great , let 's go !
hey , darling , i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world .
exactly . you know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . you remember ? the island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
yes , it was wonderful but it 's already been a year . how time flies !
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? we can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
are you kidding ? can you afford it ? do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
never mind that , i 'll take care of it . are you available next week ?
yeah , i think so .
ok . i 'll make the arrangements . it will be great .
wonderful ! i 'll start packing our suitcases .
